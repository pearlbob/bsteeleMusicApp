# bsteeleMusicApp

The application was designed to play music in a group,
where the songs are not necessarily known by all players.
Even more accomplished players may need a reminder of song structure.

Motovation for the app was supplied by [Community Jams](http://communityjams.org)
in Portland, Oregon. 

Songs can be entered and edited in the app.
The transposition function makes that task easy as well.

One odd part about the application is that the files created from song
entry are stored locally.  Typically in the Downloads folder in the user's home.
This is intentional.  The user can keep their songs private or share them by
emailing the songlyrics file.  You can remove all the standard songs and read your own
into the application with a few clicks.
