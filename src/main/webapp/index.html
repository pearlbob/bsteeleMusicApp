                    There must be some way out of here" said the joker to the thief

                    Businessmen, they drink my wine, plowmen dig my earth

                    "There are many here among us who feel that life is but a joke
                    But you and I, we've been through that, and this is not our fate
                    So let us not talk falsely now, the hour is getting late".

                    All along the watchtower, princes kept the view
                    While all the women came and went, barefoot servants, too.

                    Outside in the distance a wildcat did growl
                    Two riders were approaching, the wind began to howl.

                    Is the baddest part of town
                    And if you go down there
                    You better just beware
                    Of a man name of Leroy Brown
                    v:
                    Now Leroy more than trouble
                    You see he stand ‘bout six foot four
                    All those downtown ladies call him "Treetop Lover"

                    Now Leroy he a gambler
                    And he like his fancy clothes
                    And he like to wave his diamond rings
                    Under everybody's nose
                    v:
                    He got a custom Continental
                    He got an Eldorado too
                    He got a 32 gun in his pocket full a fun

                    Leroy shootin' dice
                    And at the edge of the bar
                    Sat a girl named Doris
                    And oh that girl looked nice
                    v:
                    Well he cast his eyes upon her
                    And the trouble soon began
                    And Leroy Brown had learned a lesson 
                    'Bout a-messin' with the wife of a jealous man

                    Well the two men took to fighting
                    And when they pulled them from the floor
                    Leroy looked like a jigsaw puzzle
                    With a couple of pieces gone
                    c:
                    And it's bad, bad Leroy Brown
                    The baddest man in the whole damn town

                    Every time I think of you
                    I feel shot right through with a bolt of blue
                    It's no problem of mine
                    But it's a problem I find
                    Living a life that I can't leave behind
                    But there's no sense in telling me
                    The wisdom of the fool won't set you free
                    But that's the way that it goes
                    And it's what nobody knows

                    Not intending to stay very long 
                    When I met a frolicsome damsel

                    Seems I got to have a change of scene
                    Cause every night I have the strangest dreams
                    Imprisoned by the way it used to be
                    Left here on my own or so it seems
                    I got to leave before I start to scream
                    But someone's locked the door and took the key

                    Feelin' alright
                    Not feelin' too good myself
                    Feelin' alright
                    Not feelin' too good myself

                    Boy you sure took me for one big ride
                    Even now I sit and wonder why
                    And when I think of you I start to cry
                    Got to stop belivin' in all your lies
                    Cause I got to much to do before I die

                    Before someone comes along and takes my place
                    With a different name and yes a different face

                    I must have been through about a million girls
                    I'd love 'em and I'd leave 'em alone

                    Their tears left me cold as a stone

                    Since I met you baby

                    I fooled around and fell in love

                    Free, on my own that's the way I used to be
                    Ah, but since I met you baby
                    Love's got a hold on me
                    It's got a hold on me now

                    There's something happening here
                    But what it is ain't exactly clear
                    There's a man with a gun over there
                    Telling me I got to beware

                    I think it's time we stop
                    Children, what's that sound?
                    Everybody look - what's going down?

                    There's battle lines being drawn
                    Nobody's right if everybody's wrong
                    Young people speaking' their minds
                    Getting so much resistance from behind

                    It's time we stop
                    Hey, what's that sound?
                    Everybody look - what's going down?

                    What a field day for the heat
                    A thousand people in the street
                    Singing songs and carrying signs
                    Mostly saying, "hooray for our side"

                    It's time we stop
                    Hey, what's that sound?
                    Everybody look - what's going down?

                    Paranoia strikes deep
                    Into your life it will creep
                    It starts when you're always afraid
                    Step out of line, the men come and take you away

                    We better stop
                    Hey, what's that sound?
                    Everybody look - what's going down?

                    We better stop
                    Hey, what's that sound?
                    Everybody look - what's going down?

                    We better stop
                    Now, what's that sound?
                    Everybody look - what's going down?

                    We better stop

                    I hear the train a comin'
                    It's rolling round the bend
                    And I ain't seen the sunshine since I don't know when,
                    I'm stuck in Folsom prison, and time keeps draggin' on
                    But that train keeps a rollin' on down to San Antone..
                    When I was just a baby my mama told me. Son,
                    Always be a good boy, don't ever play with guns.
                    But I shot a man in Reno just to watch him die
                    When I hear that whistle blowing, I hang my head and cry..

                    I bet there's rich folks eating in a fancy dining car
                    They're probably drinkin' coffee and smoking big cigars.
                    Well I know I had it coming, I know I can't be free
                    But those people keep a movin'
                    And that's what tortures me...

                    Well if they freed me from this prison,
                    If that railroad train was mine
                    I bet I'd move it on a little farther down the line
                    Far from Folsom prison, that's where I want to stay
                    And I'd let that lonesome whistle blow my blues away.....

                    On a warm summer's eve
                    On a train bound for nowhere
                    I met up with the gambler
                    We were both too tired to sleep
                    So we took turns a-starin'
                    Out the window at the darkness
                    The boredom overtook us, he began to speak

                    He said, "Son, I've made a life
                    Out of readin' people's faces
                    Knowin' what the cards were
                    By the way they held their eyes
                    So if you don't mind me sayin'
                    I can see you're out of aces
                    For a taste of your whiskey
                    I'll give you some advice"

                    So I handed him my bottle
                    And he drank down my last swallow
                    Then he bummed a cigarette
                    And asked me for a light
                    And the night got deathly quiet
                    And his faced lost all expression
                    He said, "If you're gonna play the game, boy
                    You gotta learn to play it right

                    You've got to know when to hold 'em
                    Know when to fold 'em
                    Know when to walk away
                    Know when to run
                    You never count your money
                    When you're sittin' at the table
                    There'll be time enough for countin'
                    When the dealin's done

                    Every gambler knows
                    That the secret to survivin'
                    Is knowin' what to throw away
                    And knowin' what to keep
                    'Cause every hand's a winner
                    And every hand's a loser
                    And the best that you can hope for
                    Is to die in your sleep"

                    And when he finished speakin'
                    He turned back toward the window
                    Crushed out his cigarette
                    And faded off to sleep
                    And somewhere in the darkness
                    The gambler he broke even
                    And in his final words
                    I found an ace that I could keep

                    Now I've heard there was a secret chord
                    That David played, and it pleased the Lord
                    But you don't really care for music, do you?
                    It goes like this
                    The fourth, the fifth
                    The minor fall, the major lift
                    The baffled king composing Hallelujah

                    Hallelujah
                    Hallelujah
                    Hallelujah
                    Hallelujah

                    Your faith was strong but you needed proof
                    You saw her bathing on the roof
                    Her beauty and the moonlight overthrew you
                    She tied you to a kitchen chair
                    She broke your throne, and she cut your hair
                    And from your lips she drew the Hallelujah

                    Hallelujah, Hallelujah
                    Hallelujah, Hallelujah
                    You say I took the name in vain
                    I don't even know the name
                    But if I did, well really, what's it to you?
                    There's a blaze of light
                    In every word
                    It doesn't matter which you heard
                    The holy or the broken Hallelujah

                    Hallelujah, Hallelujah
                    Hallelujah, Hallelujah

                    I did my best, it wasn't much
                    I couldn't feel, so I tried to touch
                    I've told the truth, I didn't come to fool you
                    And even though it all went wrong
                    I'll stand before the Lord of Song
                    With nothing on my tongue but Hallelujah

                    Hallelujah, Hallelujah
                    Hallelujah, Hallelujah
                    Hallelujah, Hallelujah

                    When I walk beside her, I am the better man
                    When I look to leave her, I always stagger back again
                    Once I built an ivory tower so I could worship from above
                    When I climbed down to be set free, she took me in again

                    [Chorus:]
                    There's a big, a big hard sun
                    Beating on the big people
                    In the big hard world

                    When she comes to greet me, she is mercy at my feet
                    When I see her bitter charm, she just throws it back at me
                    Once I dug an early grave to find a better land
                    She just smiled and laughed at me and took her blues back again

                    [Chorus 2x]

                    When I go to cross that river, she is comfort by my side
                    When I try to understand, she just opens up her hands

                    [Chorus]

                    Once I stood to lose her when I saw what I had done
                    Bound down and threw away the hours of her garden and her sun
                    So I tried to warn her, I turned to see her weep
                    Forty days and forty nights and it's still coming down on me

                    [Chorus 8x]

                    no you can't take it
                    no you can't take that away from me
                    no you can't take it
                    no you can't take it
                    no you can't take that away from me

                    head like a hole.
                    black as your soul.
                    I'd rather die than give you control.
                    head like a hole.
                    black as your soul.
                    I'd rather die than give you control.

                    [Chorus:]
                    bow down before the one you serve.
                    you're going to get what you deserve.
                    bow down before the one you serve.
                    you're going to get what you deserve.

                    God money's not looking for the cure.
                    God money's not concerned with the sick amongst the pure.
                    God money let's go dancing on the backs of the bruised.
                    God money's not one to choose

                    [Bridge]

                    [Chorus]

                    [Chorus]

                    [Bridge]

                    Two jumps in a week
                    I bet you think that's pretty clever don't you boy?
                    Flying on your motorcycle,
                    Watching all the ground beneath you drop
                    You'd kill yourself for recognition,
                    Kill yourself to never ever stop
                    You broke another mirror,
                    You're turning into something you are not

                    Don't leave me high, don't leave me dry
                    Don't leave me high, don't leave me dry

                    Drying up in conversation,
                    You will be the one who cannot talk
                    All your insides fall to pieces,
                    You just sit there wishing you could still make love
                    They're the ones who'll hate you
                    When you think you've got the world all sussed out
                    They're the ones who'll spit at you,
                    You will be the one screaming out

                    Don't leave me high, don't leave me dry
                    Don't leave me high, don't leave me dry

                    It's the best thing that you ever had,
                    The best thing that you ever, ever had
                    It's the best thing that you ever had,
                    The best thing you ever had has gone away

                    Don't leave me high, don't leave me dry
                    Don't leave me high, don't leave me dry
                    Don't leave me high, don't leave me dry

                    Deep down in Louisiana close to New Orleans
                    Way back up in the woods among the evergreens
                    There stood a log cabin made of earth and wood
                    Where lived a country boy named Johnny B. Goode
                    Who never ever learned to read or write so well
                    But he could play a guitar just like a-ringing a bell

                    Go go
                    Go Johnny go!
                    Go
                    Go Johnny go!
                    Go
                    Go Johnny go!
                    Go
                    Go Johnny go!
                    Go
                    Johnny B. Goode!

                    He used to carry his guitar in a gunny sack
                    Go sit beneath the tree by the railroad track
                    Oh, the engineer would see him sittin' in the shade
                    Strummin' with the rhythm that the drivers made
                    The people passing by, they would stop and say
                    "Oh my, but that little country boy could play"

                    Go go
                    Go Johnny go!
                    Go
                    Go Johnny go!
                    Go
                    Go Johnny go!
                    Go
                    Go Johnny go!
                    Go
                    Johnny B. Goode!

                    His mother told him, "Someday you will be a man,
                    And you will be the leader of a big ol' band
                    Many people comin' from miles around
                    To hear you play your music when the sun go down
                    Maybe someday your name'll be in lights
                    Sayin' 'Johnny B. Goode tonight!'"

                    Go go
                    Go Johnny go!
                    Go go go Johnny go!
                    Go go go Johnny go!
                    Go go go Johnny go!
                    Go

                    Please don't take him even though you can

                    I had to have this talk with you
                    My happiness depends on you
                    And whatever you decide to do, Jolene

                    And you could have your choice of men
                    But I could never love again
                    Cause he's the only one for me, Jolene, Jolene

                    Jolene, Jolene, Jolene, Jolene
                    Oh, I'm begging of you please don't take my man
                    Jolene, Jolene, Jolene, Jolene
                    Please don't take him even though you can

                    I got a little change in my pocket going ching-a-ling-a-ling
                    Wanna call you on the telephone, baby, give you a ring
                    But each time we talk, I get the same old thing
                    Always, "No huggee, no kissee until I get a wedding ring"
                    My honey, my baby, don't put my love upon no shelf
                    She said, "Don't hand me no lines and keep your hands to yourself"

                    Ooh, baby, baby, baby, why you gonna treat me this way?
                    You know I'm still your loverboy, I still feel the same way
                    That's when she told me a story 'bout free milk and a cow
                    And said, "No huggee, no kissee until I get a wedding vow"
                    My honey, my baby, don't put my love upon no shelf
                    She said, "Don't hand me no lines and keep your hands to yourself"

                    You see, I wanted her real bad and I was about to give in
                    That's when she started talking about true love, started talking about sin
                    I said, "Honey, I'll live with you for the rest of my life"
                    She said, "No huggee, no kissee until you make me a wife"
                    My honey, my baby, don't put my love upon no shelf
                    She said, "Don't hand me no lines and keep your hands to yourself"

                    You were a child
                    Crawling on your knees toward it
                    Making momma so proud
                    But your voice is too loud
                    We like to watch you laughing
                    You pick the insects off plants
                    No time to think of consequences

                    [Chorus:]
                    Control yourself
                    Take only what you need from it
                    A family of trees wanting to be haunted
                    Control yourself
                    Take only what you need from it
                    A family of trees wanting to be haunted

                    The water is warm
                    But it's sending me shivers
                    A baby is born
                    Crying out for attention
                    Memories fade
                    Like looking through a fogged mirror
                    Decisions too
                    Decisions are made and not bought
                    But I thought this wouldn't hurt a lot
                    I guess not

                    She grew up in an Indiana town
                    Had a good-lookin' mama who never was around
                    But she grew up tall and she grew up right
                    With them Indiana boys on them Indiana nights

                    Well, she moved down here at the age of eighteen
                    She blew the boys away, was more than they'd seen
                    I was introduced and we both started groovin'
                    She said, "I dig you baby, but I got to keep movin' on
                    Keep movin' on"

                    Last dance with Mary Jane, one more time to kill the pain

                    Well, I don't know, but I've been told
                    You never slow down, you never grow old
                    I'm tired of screwin' up, tired of going down
                    Tired of myself, tired of this town

                    Oh, my my, oh, hell yes
                    Honey, put on that party dress
                    Buy me a drink, sing me a song
                    Take me as I come 'cause I can't stay long

                    There's pigeons down on Market Square
                    She's standin' in her underwear
                    Lookin' down from a hotel room
                    Nightfall will be comin' soon

                    Oh, my my, oh, hell yes.
                    You got to put on that party dress
                    It was too cold to cry when I woke up alone
                    I hit my last number and walked to the road

                    The stairs creak as you sleep, it's keeping me awake
                    It's the house telling you to close your eyes

                    Well tell her that I miss our little talks
                    Soon it will be over and buried with our past
                    We used to play outside when we were young
                    And full of life and full of love.

                    Some days I don't know if I am wrong or right

                    I watched you disappear
                    All that's left is a ghost of you.
                    Now we're torn, torn, torn apart,

                    When I find myself in times of trouble
                    Mother Mary comes to me
                    Speaking words of wisdom
                    Let it be

                    And in my hour of darkness
                    She is standing right in front of me
                    Speaking words of wisdom
                    Let it be

                    Let it be, let it be, let it be, let it be

                    Let it be

                    And when the broken-hearted people
                    Living in the world agree
                    There will be an answer
                    Let it be

                    For though they may be parted there is
                    Still a chance that they will see
                    There will be an answer
                    Let it be

                    Let it be, let it be, let it be, let it be

                    Let it be

                    And when the night is cloudy
                    There is still a light that shines on me
                    Shine until tomorrow
                    Let it be

                    I wake up to the sound of music
                    Mother Mary comes to me
                    Speaking words of wisdom
                    Let it be

                    Let it be, let it be, let it be, yeah, let it be

                    I want love to: grab my fingers gently,

                    I want love to: murder my own mother,
                    Take her off to somewhere, like hell, or up above.
                    And I want love to: change my friends to enemies,
                    Change my friends to enemies, and show me how it's all my fault.

                    Grab a hold of me and fight me, leave me dying on the ground.
                    I want love to: split my mouth wide open,
                    And cover up my ears and never let me hear a sound
                    I want love to: forget that you offended me,

                    All you want to do is ride around Sally, ride, Sally, ride.

                    One of these early mornings, oh, you gonna be wiping your weeping eyes.
                    I bought you a brand new mustang 'bout nineteen sixty five
                    Now you come around signifying a woman, you don't wanna let me ride.
                    Mustang Sally, think you better slow your mustang down.
                    You been running all over the town now.
                    Oh! I guess I'll have to put your flat feet on the ground.

                    All you want to do is ride around Sally, ride, Sally, ride.
                    All you want to do is ride around Sally, ride, Sally, ride.
                    All you want to do is ride around Sally, ride, Sally, ride.

                    You got someone to blame
                    You say...

                    One love

                    In the night
                    One love
                    We get to share it
                    Leaves you baby if you 
                    Don't care for it

                    Did I disappoint you
                    Or leave a bad taste in your mouth
                    You act like you never had love
                    And you want me to go without
                    Well it's...

                    Too late
                    Tonight
                    To drag the past out into the light
                    We're one, but we're not the same
                    We get to 
                    Carry each other
                    Carry each other
                    One...

                    Have you come here for forgiveness
                    Have you come to raise the dead
                    Have you come here to play Jesus
                    To the lepers in your head

                    Did I ask too much
                    More than a lot
                    You gave me nothing
                    Now it's all I got
                    We're one
                    But we're not the same
                    Well we 
                    Hurt each other
                    Then we do it again
                    You say
                    Love is a temple
                    Love a higher law
                    Love is a temple
                    Love the higher law
                    You ask me to enter
                    But then you make me crawl
                    And I can't be holding on
                    To what you got
                    When all you got is hurt

                    I'm at a payphone trying to call home
                    All of my change I spent on you
                    Where have the times gone? Baby, it's all wrong
                    Where are the plans we made for two?

                    Yeah, I, I know it's hard to remember
                    The people we used to be...
                    It's even harder to picture,
                    That you're not here next to me.

                    You say it's too late to make it,
                    But is it too late to try?
                    And in our time that you wasted
                    All of our bridges burned down

                    I've wasted my nights,
                    You turned out the lights
                    Now I'm paralyzed.
                    Still stuck in that time
                    When we called it love
                    But even the sun sets in paradise

                    I'm at a payphone trying to call home
                    All of my change I spent on you
                    Where have the times gone? Baby, it's all wrong
                    Where are the plans we made for two?

                    If "Happy Ever After" did exist,
                    I would still be holding you like this
                    [Explicit:] All those fairy tales are full of shit
                    [Clean:] All those fairy tales are full of it.
                    [Explicit:] One more fucking love song, I'll be sick.
                    [Clean:] One more stupid love song, I'll be sick

                    Oh, you turned your back on tomorrow
                    'Cause you forgot yesterday.
                    I gave you my love to borrow,
                    But you just gave it away.

                    You can't expect me to be fine,
                    I don't expect you to care
                    I know I've said it before
                    But all of our bridges burned down.

                    I've wasted my nights,
                    You turned out the lights

                    Now when you see me I'm stunning,
                    And all of my cars start with a push of a button

                    Switch the number to my phone
                    So you never could call it,
                    Don't need my name on my shirt,
                    You can tell it I'm ballin.
                    Swish, what a shame could have got picked
                    Had a really good game but you missed your last shot
                    So you talk about who you see at the top
                    Or what you could have saw but sad to say it's over for.

                    Love is a burning thing
                    And it makes a fiery ring.
                    Bound by wild desire
                    I fell into a ring of fire.

                    [2x]
                    I fell into a burning ring of fire,
                    I went down, down, down and the flames went higher
                    And it burns, burns, burns,
                    The ring of fire, the ring of fire.

                    The taste of love is sweet
                    When hearts like ours meet.
                    I fell for you like a child,
                    Oh, but the fire went wild.

                    I fell into a burning ring of fire,
                    I went down, down, down and the flames went higher
                    And it burns, burns, burns,
                    The ring of fire, the ring of fire.

                    I fell into a burning ring of fire,
                    I went down, down, down as the flames went higher
                    And it burns, burns, burns,
                    The ring of fire, the ring of fire.

                    And it burns, burns, burns,
                    The ring of fire, the ring of fire,
                    The ring of fire, the ring of fire.

                    There's colors on the street
                    Red, white and blue
                    People shufflin' their feet
                    People sleepin' in their shoes
                    But there's a warnin' sign
                    on the road ahead
                    There's a lot of people sayin'
                    we'd be better off dead
                    Don't feel like Satan,
                    but I am to them
                    So I try to forget it,
                    any way I can.

                    Keep on rockin' in the free world,
                    Keep on rockin' in the free world
                    Keep on rockin' in the free world,
                    Keep on rockin' in the free world.

                    I see a woman in the night
                    With a baby in her hand
                    Under an old street light
                    Near a garbage can
                    Now she puts the kid away,
                    and she's gone to get a hit
                    She hates her life,
                    and what she's done to it
                    There's one more kid
                    that will never go to school
                    Never get to fall in love,
                    never get to be cool.

                    Keep on rockin' in the free world,
                    Keep on rockin' in the free world
                    Keep on rockin' in the free world,
                    Keep on rockin' in the free world.

                    We got a thousand points of light
                    For the homeless man
                    We got a kinder, gentler,
                    Machine gun hand
                    We got department stores
                    and toilet paper
                    Got styrofoam boxes
                    for the ozone layer
                    Got a man of the people,
                    says keep hope alive
                    Got fuel to burn,
                    got roads to drive.

                    Keep on rockin' in the free world,
                    Keep on rockin' in the free world

                    I've never seen a diamond in the flesh
                    I cut my teeth on wedding rings in the movies
                    And I'm not proud of my address,
                    In a torn-up town, no postcode envy

                    But every song's like gold teeth, grey goose, trippin' in the bathroom
                    Blood stains, ball gowns, trashin' the hotel room,
                    We don't care, we're driving Cadillacs in our dreams.
                    But everybody's like Cristal, Maybach, diamonds on your timepiece.
                    Jet planes, islands, tigers on a gold leash.
                    We don't care, we aren't caught up in your love affair.

                    And we'll never be royals (royals).
                    It don't run in our blood,
                    That kind of luxe just ain't for us.
                    We crave a different kind of buzz.
                    Let me be your ruler (ruler),
                    You can call me queen Bee
                    And baby I'll rule, I'll rule, I'll rule, I'll rule.
                    Let me live that fantasy.

                    [Verse 2]
                    My friends and I—we've cracked the code.
                    We count our dollars on the train to the party.
                    And everyone who knows us knows that we're fine with this,
                    We didn't come from money.

                    But every song's like gold teeth, grey goose, trippin' in the bathroom.
                    Blood stains, ball gowns, trashin' the hotel room,
                    We don't care, we're driving Cadillacs in our dreams.
                    But everybody's like Cristal, Maybach, diamonds on your timepiece.

                    And we'll never be royals (royals).
                    It don't run in our blood

                    Let me live that fantasy.

                    Ooh ooh oh
                    We're bigger than we ever dreamed,
                    And I'm in love with being queen.
                    Ooh ooh oh
                    Life is great without a care
                    We aren't caught up in your love affair.

                    And we'll never be royals (royals).

                    As I walk along, I wonder
                    A-what went wrong with our love
                    A love that was so strong

                    And as I still walk on, I think of
                    The things we've done together
                    While our hearts were young

                    I'm a-walkin' in the rain
                    Tears are fallin' and I feel the pain
                    Wishin' you were here by me

                    Why, why, why, why, why
                    She ran away

                    And I wonder

                    My little runaway
                    A-run, run, run, run, runaway

                    I'll sing it one last time for you
                    Then we really have to go
                    You've been the only thing that's right
                    In all I've done

                    And I can barely look at you
                    But every single time I do
                    I know we'll make it anywhere
                    Away from here

                    I can hardly speak I understand
                    Why you can't raise your voice to say

                    To think I might not see those eyes
                    Makes it so hard not to cry
                    And as we say our long goodbye
                    I nearly do

                    Light up, light up

                    And we'll run for our lives
                    I can hardly speak I understand
                    Why you can't raise your voice to say

                    Slower slower
                    We don't have time for that
                    All I want's to find an easy way
                    To get out of our little heads

                    Have heart, my dear
                    We're bound to be afraid
                    Even if it's just for a few days
                    Making up for all this mess

                    Light up, light up
                    As if you have a choice

                    Call you up in the middle of the night
                    like a firefly without a light
                    you were there like a blowtorch burning
                    i was a key that could use a little turning
                    so tired that i couldn't even sleep
                    so many secrets i couldn't keep
                    promised myself i wouldn't weep
                    one more promise i couldn't keep

                    it seems no one can help me now
                    i'm in too deep
                    there's no way out
                    this time i have really lead myself astray

                    runaway train, never goin' back
                    wrong way on a one-way track
                    seems like i should be getting somewhere
                    somehow i'm neither here nor there

                    can you help me remember how to smile?
                    make it somehow all seem worthwhile
                    how on earth did i get so jaded?
                    life's mysteries seem so faded
                    i can go where noone else can go
                    i know what no one else knows
                    here i am just drownin' in the rain
                    with a ticket for a runaway train

                    and everything seems cut and dry
                    day and night
                    earth and sky
                    somehow i just don't believe it

                    runaway train, never goin' back
                    wrong way on a one-way track
                    seems like i should be getting somewhere
                    somehow i'm neither here nor there

                    bought a ticket for a runaway train
                    like a madman laughing at the rain
                    little out of touch, little insane
                    it's just easier than dealing with the pain

                    runaway train, never goin' back
                    wrong way on a one-way track
                    seems like i should be getting somewhere
                    somehow i'm neither here nor there

                    runaway train, never comin' back
                    runaway train, tearin' up the track
                    runaway train, burnin' in my veins
                    i run away but it always seems the same

                    Take all of your wasted honor
                    Every little past frustration
                    Take all of your so-called problems,
                    Better put 'em in quotations

                    Say what you need to say [8x]

                    Walking like a one man army
                    Fighting with the shadows in your head
                    Living out the same old moment
                    Knowing you'd be better off instead,
                    If you could only . . .

                    Say what you need to say [8x]

                    Have no fear for giving in
                    Have no fear for giving over
                    You'd better know that in the end
                    It's better to say too much
                    Than never to say what you need to say again

                    Even if your hands are shaking
                    And your faith is broken
                    Even as the eyes are closing
                    Do it with a heart wide open (a wide heart)

                    Say what you need to say [24x]

                    Come back and haunt me
                    Oh, and I rush to the start

                    Running in circles
                    Chasing our tails
                    Coming back as we are

                    Nobody said it was easy
                    Oh, it's such a shame for us to part
                    Nobody said it was easy

                    Now yonder stands a man in this lonely crowd
                    A man who swears he's not to blame
                    All day long I hear him shouting so loud
                    Just crying out that he was framed

                    Me and my friend made a comic book

                    Just called to say that it's good to be
                    Alive in such a small world
                    I'm all curled up with a book to read

                    My tower secure
                    My cause is noble
                    My power is pure
                    I can handout a million vaccinations

                    Have 'em all healed from their lacerations
                    Or have 'em all killed by assassination
                    I can make anybody go to prison
                    Just because I don't like them
                    And I can do anything with no permission
                    I have it all under my command because

                    I can guide a missile by satellite

                    Through a telescope

                    And I can end the planet in a holocaust

                    Holly came from Miami, F.L.A.
                    Hitch-hiked her way across the U.S.A.
                    Plucked her eyebrows on the way
                    Shaved her legs and then he was a she
                    She says, "Hey, babe,
                    Take a walk on the wild side."
                    Said, "Hey, honey,
                    Take a walk on the wild side."

                    Candy came from out on the Island
                    In the back room she was everybody's darling
                    But she never lost her head
                    Even when she was giving head
                    She says, "Hey, babe,
                    Take a walk on the wild side."
                    Said, "Hey, babe,
                    Take a walk on the wild side."
                    And the colored girls go
                    "Doo do doo do doo do do doo..."

                    Little Joe never once gave it away
                    Everybody had to pay and pay
                    A hustle here and a hustle there
                    New York City's the place
                    Where they said, "Hey, babe,
                    Take a walk on the wild side."
                    I said, "Hey, Joe,
                    Take a walk on the wild side."

                    Sugar Plum Fairy came and hit the streets
                    Looking for soul food and a place to eat
                    Went to the Apollo
                    You should've seen them go, go, go
                    They said, "Hey, sugar,
                    Take a walk on the wild side."
                    I said, "Hey, babe,
                    Take a walk on the wild side."
                    All right, huh

                    Jackie is just speeding away
                    Thought she was James Dean for a day
                    Then I guess she had to crash
                    Valium would have helped that bash
                    Said, "Hey, babe,
                    Take a walk on the wild side."
                    I said, "Hey, honey,
                    Take a walk on the wild side."
                    And the colored girls say,

                    'Twas in another lifetime one of toil and blood
                    When blackness was a virtue, the road was full of mud
                    I came in from the wilderness a creature void of form
                    "Come in," she said,
                    "I'll give you shelter from the storm."

                    And if I pass this way again you can rest assured
                    I'll always do my best for her on that I give my word
                    In a world of steel-eyed death and men who are fighting to be warm
                    "Come in," she said,
                    "I'll give you shelter from the storm."

                    Not a word was spoke between us there was little risk involved
                    Everything up to that point had been left unresolved
                    Try imagining a place where it's always safe and warm
                    "Come in," she said,
                    "I'll give you shelter from the storm."

                    I was burned out from exhaustion buried in the hail
                    Poisoned in the bushes and blown out on the trail
                    Hunted like a crocodile ravaged in the corn
                    "Come in," she said,
                    "I'll give you shelter from the storm."

                    Suddenly I turned around and she was standing there
                    With silver bracelets on her wrists and flowers in her hair
                    She walked up to me so gracefully and took my crown of thorns
                    "Come in," she said,
                    "I'll give you shelter from the storm."

                    Now there's a wall between us something there's been lost
                    I took too much for granted, I got my signals crossed
                    Just to think that it all began on an uneventful morn
                    "Come in," she said,
                    "I'll give you shelter from the storm."

                    Well the deputy walks on hard nails and the preacher rides a mount
                    But nothing really matters much it's doom alone that counts
                    And the one-eyed undertaker he blows a futile horn
                    "Come in," she said,
                    "I'll give you shelter from the storm."

                    I've heard newborn babies wailing like a mourning dove
                    And old men with broken teeth stranded without love
                    Do I understand your question man, is it hopeless and forlorn?
                    "Come in," she said,
                    "I'll give you shelter from the storm."

                    In a little hilltop village they gambled for my clothes
                    I bargained for salvation and she gave me a lethal dose
                    I offered up my innocence, I got repaid with scorn
                    "Come in," she said,
                    "I'll give you shelter from the storm."

                    Well I'm living in a foreign country but I'm bound to cross the line
                    Beauty walks a razor's edge someday I'll make it mine
                    If I could only turn back the clock to when God and her were born
                    "Come in," she said,
                    "I'll give you shelter from the storm."

                    Is elusive as the answers that I find

                    Day to day
                    Where do you want to be?
                    'Cos now you're trying to pick a fight
                    With everyone you need

                    You seem like a soldier
                    Who's lost his composure
                    You're wounded and playing a waiting game
                    In no-man's land no-one's to blame

                    See the world
                    Find an old fashioned girl
                    And when all's been said and done
                    It's the things that are given, not won
                    Are the things that you earned

                    Empty handed, surrounded by a senseless scene
                    With nothing of significance
                    Besides a shadow of a dream
                    You sound like an old joke
                    You're worn out, a bit broken
                    Asking me time and time again
                    And the answer's still the same

                    See the world
                    Find an old fashioned girl
                    And when all's been said and done
                    It's the things that are given, not won
                    Are the things that you earned

                    You've got a chance to put things right
                    So how's it going to be?
                    Lay down your arms now
                    And put us beyond doubt
                    So reach out it's not too far away
                    Don't mess around now, don't delay

                    See the world...[etc]

                    Met a girl, thought she was grand
                    fell in love, found out first hand
                    went well for a week or two
                    then it all came unglued

                    In a trap, trip I can't grip
                    never thought I'd be the one who'd slip
                    then I started to realize
                    I was living one big lie

                    She fucking hates me
                    trust
                    she fucking hates me
                    la la la love
                    I tried too hard
                    and she tore my feelings like I had none
                    and ripped them away

                    She was queen for about an hour
                    after that shit got sour
                    she took all I ever had
                    no sign of guilt
                    no feeling of bad, no

                    In a trap, trip I can't grip
                    never thought I'd be the one who'd slip
                    then I started to realize
                    I was living one big lie

                    [Chorus]

                    that's my story, as you see
                    learned my lesson and so did she
                    now it's over and I'm glad
                    'cause I'm a fool for all I've said

                    [Chorus]

                    la la la la la la la la la love
                    Trust
                    la la la la la la la la la love
                    Trust
                    and she tore my feelings like I had none
                    she fucking hates me

                    This indecision's buggin' me (Indecisión me molesta)
                    If you don't want me, set me free (Si no me quieres, librame)
                    Exactly whom I'm supposed to be (Dime! ¿Qué tengo ser?)
                    Don't you know which clothes even fit me? (¿Sabes que ropa me quedar?)
                    Come on and let me know (Pero tienes que decir)
                    Should I cool it or should I blow? (¿Me debo ir o quedarme?)

                    Split

                    (Doble! ¿Me frío o lo soplo?)
                    (Esperda)

                    Only to be with you

                    I have run, I have crawled

                    Said it was

                    I have kissed honey lips

                    It burned like fire

                    I have spoken with the tongue of angels

                    It was warm in the night
                    I was cold as a star

                    But I still haven’t found what I’m looking for

                    Bleeding the one
                    Yes, I’m still running

                    He broke the bounds, he loose the chains
                    Carried the cross of my shame
                    Broke my shame
                    You know I believed it

                    Big wheels keep on turning 
                    Carry me home to see my kin 
                    Singing songs about the Southland 
                    I miss Alabamy once again 
                    And I think its a sin, yes

                    Well I heard mister Young sing about her 
                    Well, I heard ole Neil put her down 
                    Well, I hope Neil Young will remember 
                    A Southern man don't need him around anyhow

                    Sweet home Alabama 
                    Where the skies are so blue 
                    Sweet Home Alabama 
                    Lord, I'm coming home to you

                    In Birmingham they love the gov' nor (boo, boo, boo)
                    Now we all did what we could do 
                    Now Watergate does not bother me 
                    Does your conscience bother you? 
                    Tell the truth

                    Sweet home Alabama 
                    Where the skies are so blue 
                    Sweet Home Alabama 
                    Lord, I'm coming home to you 
                    Here I come Alabama

                    Now Muscle Shoals has got the Swampers 
                    And they've been known to pick a song or two 
                    Lord they get me off so much 
                    They pick me up when I'm feeling blue 
                    Now how about you?

                    Sweet home Alabama 
                    Where the skies are so blue 
                    Sweet Home Alabama 
                    Lord, I'm coming home to you

                    Sweet home Alabama 
                    Oh sweet home baby 
                    Where the skies are so blue 
                    And the guv'nor's true

                    Please allow me to introduce myself
                    I'm a man of wealth and taste
                    I've been around for a long, long year
                    Stole many a man's soul and faith

                    And I was 'round when Jesus Christ
                    Had his moment of doubt and pain
                    Made damn sure that Pilate
                    Washed his hands and sealed his fate

                    Pleased to meet you
                    Hope you guess my name
                    But what's puzzling you
                    Is the nature of my game

                    I stuck around St. Petersburg
                    When I saw it was a time for a change
                    Killed the Tsar and his ministers
                    Anastasia screamed in vain

                    I rode a tank
                    Held a general's rank
                    When the blitzkrieg raged
                    And the bodies stank

                    Pleased to meet you
                    Hope you guess my name, oh yeah
                    Ah, what's puzzling you
                    Is the nature of my game, oh yeah

                    I watched with glee
                    While your kings and queens
                    Fought for ten decades
                    For the gods they made

                    I shouted out,
                    "Who killed the Kennedys?"
                    When after all
                    It was you and me

                    Let me please introduce myself
                    I'm a man of wealth and taste
                    And I laid traps for troubadours
                    Who get killed before they reached Bombay

                    Pleased to meet you
                    Hope you guessed my name, oh yeah
                    But what's puzzling you
                    Is the nature of my game, oh yeah, get down, baby

                    Pleased to meet you
                    Hope you guessed my name, oh yeah
                    But what's confusing you
                    Is just the nature of my game

                    Just as every cop is a criminal
                    And all the sinners saints
                    As heads is tails
                    Just call me Lucifer

                    Cause I'm in need of some restraint
                    So if you meet me
                    Have some courtesy
                    Have some sympathy, and some taste

                    Use all your well-learned politesse
                    Or I'll lay your soul to waste, um yeah
                    Pleased to meet you
                    Hope you guessed my name, um yeah

                    But what's puzzling you
                    Is the nature of my game, um mean it, get down
                    Woo, who
                    Oh yeah, get on down

                    Oh yeah
                    Oh yeah!

                    Tell me honey, can ya guess my name

                    Tell me baby, what's my name

                    Almost heaven, West Virginia, Blue Ridge Mountains, Shenandoah River.
                    Life is old there, older than the trees, younger than the mountains, blowing like a breeze.

                    Country roads, take me home to the place I belong.
                    West Virginia, mountain mamma, take me home, country roads.

                    All my memories gather round her, miner's lady, stranger to blue water.
                    Dark and dusty, painted on the sky, misty taste of moonshine, teardrop in my eye.

                    Country roads, take me home to the place I belong.
                    West Virginia, mountain mamma, take me home, country roads.

                    I hear her voice in the morning hour, she calls me, the radio reminds me of my home far away.
                    And driving down the road I get a feeling that I should have been home yesterday, yesterday.

                    Country roads, take me home to the place I belong.
                    West Virginia, mountain mamma, take me home, country roads.

                    Country roads, take me home to the place I belong.
                    West Virginia, mountain mamma, take me home, country roads

                    Take me home now, country roads,
                    Take me home now, country roads.

                    This here's a story about Billy Joe and Bobbie Sue
                    Two young lovers with nothin' better to do
                    Than sit around the house, get high, and watch the tube
                    And here is what happened when they decided to cut loose

                    They headed down to, ooh, old El Paso
                    That's where they ran into a great big hassle
                    Billy Joe shot a man while robbing his castle
                    Bobbie Sue took the money and run

                    Go on take the money and run
                    Go on take the money and run
                    Go on take the money and run
                    Go on take the money and run

                    Billy Mack is a detective down in Texas
                    You know he knows just exactly what the facts is
                    He ain't gonna let those two escape justice
                    He makes his livin' off of the people's taxes

                    Bobbie Sue, whoa, whoa, she slipped away
                    Billy Joe caught up to her the very next day
                    They got the money, hey
                    You know they got away
                    They headed down south and they're still running today
                    Singin' go on take the money and run
                    Go on take the money and run
                    Go on take the money and run
                    Go on take the money and run
                    Go on take the money and run
                    Go on take the money and run
                    Go on take the money and run

                    Some say love, it is a river
                    That drowns the tender reed.
                    Some say love, it is a razor
                    That leaves your soul to bleed.
                    Some say love, it is a hunger,
                    An endless aching need.
                    I say love, it is a flower,
                    And you its only seed.

                    It's the heart afraid of breaking
                    That never learns to dance.
                    It's the dream afraid of waking
                    That never takes the chance.
                    It's the one who won't be taken,
                    Who cannot seem to give,
                    And the soul afraid of dyin'
                    That never learns to live.

                    When the night has been too lonely
                    And the road has been too long,
                    And you think that love is only
                    For the lucky and the strong,
                    Just remember in the winter
                    Far beneath the bitter snows
                    Lies the seed that with the sun's love
                    In the spring becomes the rose.

                    You get up every morning
                    From your 'larm clock's warning
                    Take the 8:15 into the city
                    There's a whistle up above
                    And people pushin', people shovin'

                    And start your slaving job to get your pay

                    Get a second-hand guitar
                    Chances are you'll go far
                    If you get in with the right bunch of fellows
                    People see you having fun
                    Just a-lying in the sun
                    Tell them that you like it this way
                    It's the work that we avoid

                    Once I ran to you (I ran)
                    Now I'll run from you
                    This tainted love you've given
                    I give you all a boy could give you
                    Take my tears and that's not nearly all
                    Tainted love (oh)
                    Tainted love

                    Now I know I've got to
                    Run away, I've got to
                    Get away, you don't really want any more from me
                    To make things right
                    You need someone to hold you tight
                    And you think love is to pray
                    But I'm sorry, I don't pray that way

                    Once I ran to you (I ran)
                    Now I'll run from you
                    This tainted love you've given
                    I give you all a boy could give you
                    Take my tears and that's not nearly all
                    Tainted love (oh)
                    Tainted love

                    Don't touch me, please
                    I cannot stand the way you tease
                    I love you though you hurt me so
                    Now I'm gonna pack my things and go

                    Tainted love (oh)
                    Tainted love (oh)
                    Tainted love (oh)
                    Tainted love (oh)

                    Touch me, baby, tainted love
                    Touch me, baby, tainted love
                    Tainted love (oh)
                    Tainted love (oh)

                    Tainted love
                    Tainted love

                    This land is your land, This land is my land
                    From California to the New York island; 
                    From the red wood forest to the Gulf Stream waters 
                    This land was made for you and Me.

                    As I was walking that ribbon of highway, 
                    I saw above me that endless skyway: 
                    I saw below me that golden valley: 
                    This land was made for you and me.

                    I've roamed and rambled and I followed my footsteps 
                    To the sparkling sands of her diamond deserts; 
                    And all around me a voice was sounding: 
                    This land was made for you and me.

                    When the sun came shining, and I was strolling, 
                    And the wheat fields waving and the dust clouds rolling, 
                    As the fog was lifting a voice was chanting: 
                    This land was made for you and me.

                    As I went walking I saw a sign there 
                    And on the sign it said "No Trespassing." 
                    But on the other side it didn't say nothing, 
                    That side was made for you and me.

                    In the shadow of the steeple I saw my people, 
                    By the relief office I seen my people; 
                    As they stood there hungry, I stood there asking 
                    Is this land made for you and me?

                    Nobody living can ever stop me, 
                    As I go walking that freedom highway; 
                    Nobody living can ever make me turn back 
                    This land was made for you and me.

                    Lying in my bed I hear the clock tick,
                    And think of you
                    Caught up in circles confusion -
                    Is nothing new
                    Flashback - warm nights -
                    Almost left behind
                    Suitcases of memories,
                    Time after -

                    Sometimes you picture me -
                    I'm walking too far ahead
                    You're calling to me, I can't hear
                    What you've said -
                    Then you say - go slow -
                    I fall behind -
                    The second hand unwinds

                    [Chorus:]
                    If you're lost you can look - and you will find me
                    Time after time
                    If you fall I will catch you - I'll be waiting 
                    Time after time

                    After my picture fades and darkness has 
                    Turned to gray
                    Watching through windows - you're wondering
                    If I'm OK
                    Secrets stolen from deep inside
                    The drum beats out of time -

                    [Chorus:]
                    If you're lost...

                    You said go slow -
                    I fall behind
                    The second hand unwinds -

                    [Chorus:]
                    If you're lost...
                    ...Time after time
                    Time after time
                    Time after time

                    Once upon a time there was a tavern
                    Where we used to raise a glass or two
                    Remember how we laughed away the hours
                    And dreamed of all the great things we would do

                    Those were the days my friend
                    We thought they'd never end
                    We'd sing and dance forever and a day
                    We'd live the life we choose
                    We'd fight and never lose
                    For we were young and sure to have our way.
                    La la la la...
                    Those were the days, oh yes those were the days

                    Then the busy years went rushing by us
                    We lost our starry notions on the way
                    If by chance I'd see you in the tavern
                    We'd smile at one another and we'd say

                    Those were the days my friend
                    We thought they'd never end
                    We'd sing and dance forever and a day
                    We'd live the life we choose
                    We'd fight and never lose
                    For we were young and sure to have our way.
                    La la la la...
                    Those were the days, oh yes those were the days

                    Just tonight I stood before the tavern
                    Nothing seemed the way it used to be
                    In the glass I saw a strange reflection
                    Was that lonely woman really me

                    Those were the days my friend
                    We thought they'd never end
                    We'd sing and dance forever and a day
                    We'd live the life we choose
                    We'd fight and never lose
                    For we were young and sure to have our way.
                    La la la la...
                    Those were the days, oh yes those were the days

                    Through the door there came familiar laughter
                    I saw your face and heard you call my name
                    Oh my friend we're older but no wiser
                    For in our hearts the dreams are still the same

                    Those were the days my friend
                    We thought they'd never end
                    We'd sing and dance forever and a day
                    We'd live the life we choose
                    We'd fight and never lose
                    For we were young and sure to have our way.
                    La la la la...

                    Twenty-five years and my life is still
                    Trying to get up that great big hill of hope
                    For a destination
                    I realized quickly when I knew I should
                    That the world was made up of this brotherhood of man
                    For whatever that means

                    And so I cry sometimes

                    What's in my head

                    And I try, oh my god do I try
                    I try all the time
                    In this institution
                    And I pray, oh my god do I pray
                    I pray every single day
                    For a revolution

                    And so I cry sometimes

                    One pill makes you larger
                    And one pill makes you small
                    And the ones that mother gives you
                    Don't do anything at all
                    Go ask Alice
                    When she's ten feet tall

                    And if you go chasing rabbits
                    And you know you're going to fall
                    Tell 'em a hookah-smoking caterpillar
                    Has given you the call
                    Call Alice
                    When she was just small

                    When the men on the chessboard
                    Get up and tell you where to go
                    And you've just had some kind of mushroom
                    And your mind is moving low
                    Go ask Alice
                    I think she'll know

                    When logic and proportion
                    Have fallen sloppy dead
                    And the White Knight is talking backwards
                    And the Red Queen's off with her head
                    Remember what the dormouse said
                    Feed your head
                    Feed your head

                    On a bed of nails
                    She makes me wait
                    And I wait without you

                    I can't live with or without you

                    Through the storm

                    And you give...
                    And you give...
                    And you give yourself away

                    My hands are tied
                    My body bruised
                    She's got me with
                    Nothing to win and
                    Nothing left to lose

                    And you give yourself away

                    Heading down south to the land of the pines
                    I'm thumbing my way into North Carolina
                    Staring up the road and pray to God I see headlights
                    I made it down the coast in seventeen hours
                    Picking me a bouquet of dogwood flowers
                    And I'm a-hopin' for Raleigh, I can see my baby tonight

                    So rock me momma like a wagon wheel
                    Rock me momma any way you feel
                    Hey momma rock me
                    Rock me momma like the wind and the rain
                    Rock me momma like a south bound train
                    Hey momma rock me

                    Running from the cold up in New England
                    I was born to be a fiddler in an old time string band
                    My baby plays a guitar, I pick a banjo now
                    Oh, north country winters keep a-getting me down
                    Lost my money playing poker so I had to leave town
                    But I ain't turning back to living that old life no more

                    So rock me momma like a wagon wheel
                    Rock me momma any way you feel
                    Hey momma rock me
                    Rock me momma like the wind and the rain
                    Rock me momma like a south bound train
                    Hey momma rock me

                    Walkin' to the south out of Roanoke
                    I caught a trucker out of Philly had a nice long toke
                    But he's a-heading west from the Cumberland gap
                    To Johnson City, Tennessee
                    I gotta get a move on before the sun
                    I hear my baby calling my name and I know that she's the only one
                    And if I die in Raleigh at least I will die free

                    So rock me momma like a wagon wheel
                    Rock me momma any way you feel
                    Hey momma rock me
                    Oh, rock me momma like the wind and the rain
                    Rock me momma like a south bound train
                    Hey, hey momma rock me

                    Oh, so rock me momma like a wagon wheel
                    Rock me momma any way you feel (I wanna feel)
                    Hey, hey momma rock me (momma rock me, momma rock me)
                    Rock me momma like the wind and the rain
                    Rock me momma like a south bound train
                    (I wanna rock like a south bound train)
                    Hey momma rock me

                    I see you've found a box of my things -
                    Infantries, tanks and smoldering airplane wings.
                    These old pictures are cool. Tell me some stories
                    Was it like the old war movies?
                    Sit down son. Let me fill you in

                    Where to begin? Let's start with the end
                    This black and white photo don't capture the skin
                    From the flash of a gun to a soldier who's done
                    Trust me grandson
                    The war was in color

                    From shipyard to sea, From factory to sky
                    From rivet to rifle, from boot camp to battle cry
                    I wore the mask up high on a daylight run
                    That held my face in its clammy hand
                    Crawled over coconut logs and corpses in the coral sand

                    Where to begin? Let's start with the end
                    This black and white photo don't capture the skin
                    From the shock of a shell or the memory of smell
                    If red is for Hell
                    The war was in color

                    I held the canvas bag over the railing
                    The dead released, with the ship still sailing,
                    Out of our hands and into the swallowing sea
                    I felt the crossfire stitching up soldiers
                    Into a blanket of dead, and as the night grows colder
                    In a window back home, a Blue Star is traded for Gold.

                    Where to begin? Let's start with the end
                    This black and white photo don't capture the skin
                    When metal is churned. And bodies are burned
                    Victory earned
                    The War was in color

                    Now I lay in my grave at age 21
                    Long before you were born
                    Before I bore a son
                    What good did it do?
                    Well hopefully for you
                    A world without war
                    A life full of color

                    Where to begin? Let's start with the end
                    This black and white photo never captured my skin
                    Once it was torn from an enemy thorn
                    Straight through the core
                    The war was in color

                    You're gonna be the one that saves me
                    You're gonna be the one that saves me
                    You're gonna be the one that saves me

                    Look at the stars,
                    Look how they shine for you,
                    And everything you do,
                    Yeah, they were all yellow.

                    I came along,
                    I wrote a song for you,
                    And all the things you do,
                    And it was called "Yellow".

                    So then I took my turn,
                    Oh what a thing to have done,
                    And it was all yellow.

                    Your skin,
                    Oh yeah your skin and bones,
                    Turn into something beautiful,
                    Do you know,
                    You know I love you so,
                    You know I love you so.

                    I swam across,
                    I jumped to cross for you,
                    Oh what a thing to do.
                    'Cause you were all yellow,

                    I drew a line,
                    I drew a line for you,
                    Oh what a thing to do,
                    And it was all yellow.

                    Your skin,
                    Oh yeah your skin and bones,
                    Turn into something beautiful,
                    Do you know,
                    For you I'd bleed myself dry,
                    For you I'd bleed myself dry.

                    It's true,
                    Look how they shine for you,
                    Look how they shine for you,
                    Look how they shine for,
                    Look how they shine for you,
                    Look how they shine for you,
                    Look how they shine.

                    Look at the stars,
                    Look how they shine for you,
                    And all the things that you do.

                    Another head hangs lowly
                    Child is slowly taken
                    And the violence caused such silence
                    Who are we mistaken

                    But you see it's not me
                    It's not my family
                    In your head, in your
                    Head they are fighting
                    With their tanks and their bombs
                    And their bombs and their guns
                    In your head,
                    In your head they are cryin'

                    In your head, in your head
                    Zombie, zombie, zombie
                    Hey, hey

                    Heart is taking over
                    When the violence causes silence
                    We must be mistaken

                    It's the same old theme since nineteen-sixteen
                    In your head,
                    In your head they're still fightin'
                    With their tanks and their bombs
                    And their bombs and their guns
                    In your head, in your head they are dyin'

                    In your head, in your head

                    She said it's cold outside and she hands me my raincoat
                    She's always worried about things like that
                    She said it's all gonna end and it might as well be my fault
                    And she only sleeps when it's raining
                    And she screams and her voice is strained
                    And

                    [Chorus:]
                    She says baby
                    It's 3 am I must be lonely
                    When she says baby
                    Well I can't help but be scared of it all sometimes
                    The rain's gonna wash away I believe it

                    She's got a little bit of something, God it's better than nothing
                    And in her color portrait world she believes that she's got it all
                    She swears the moon don't hang quite as high as it used to
                    And she only sleeps when it's raining
                    And she screams and her voice is strained...
                    And

                    [Chorus:]
                    She says baby
                    It's 3 am I must be lonely
                    Well heaven she says baby
                    Well I can't help but be scared of it all sometimes
                    Says the rain's gonna wash away I believe it

                    She believes that life is made up of all that you're used to
                    And the clock on the wall has been stuck at three for days, and days
                    She thinks that happiness is a mat that sits on her doorway
                    But outside it's stopped raining

                    [Chorus:]
                    She says baby
                    It's 3 am I must be lonely
                    Well heaven she says baby
                    Well I can't help but be scared of it all sometimes
                    Says the rain's gonna wash away I believe it

                    Well it's 3 am I must be lonely

                    Bourbon blues on the street, loose and complete
                    Under skies all smoky blue green
                    I can't forsake a dixie dead shake
                    So we danced the sidewalk clean

                    My memory is muddy, what's this river that I'm in?
                    New Orleans is sinking, man, and I don't want to swim

                    Colonel Tom, what's wrong? What's going on?
                    You can't tie yourself up for a deal
                    He said, Hey, north, you're south, shut your big mouth
                    You gotta do what you feel is real

                    Ain't got no picture postcards, ain't got no souvenirs
                    My baby she don't know me when I'm thinking bout those years

                    Pale as a light bulb hanging on a wire
                    Sucking up to someone just to stoke the fire
                    Picking out the highlights of the scenery
                    Saw a little cloud that looked a little like me

                    I had my hands in the river, my feet back up on the banks
                    Looked up to the lord above and said, Hey, man, thanks

                    Sometimes I feel so good I got to scream
                    She said, Gordie, baby, I know exactly what you mean
                    She said, she said, I swear to god she said

                    My memory is muddy, what's this river that I'm in?
                    New Orleans is sinking, man, and I don't want to swim

                    Do you have the time

                    Am I just paranoid?
                    Am I just stoned?

                    I went to a shrink
                    To analyze my dreams
                    She says it's lack of sex
                    That's bringing me down
                    I went to a whore
                    He said my life's a bore
                    So quit my whining cause
                    It's bringing her down

                    Sometimes I give myself the creeps
                    Sometimes my mind plays tricks on me
                    It all keeps adding up

                    I don't love him. Winter just wasn't my season"

                    "Just a day" he said down to the flask in his fist,

                    Here in town you can tell he's been down for a while,
                    But, my God, it's so beautiful when the boy smiles,
                    Wanna hold him. Maybe I'll just sing about it.

                    Well, some things in this world you just can't change
                    Some things you can't see until it gets too late

                    Well, we're good old boys, we come from the North Shore,
                    Drinkers and carousers the likes you've never seen;
                    And this night, by God! We drank till there was no more,
                    From the Troller to the Raven with all stops in between

                    Well it all began one afternoon on the shores of Ambleside,
                    We were sittin' there quite peacefully with the rising of the tide;
                    When an idea it came to mind for to usher in the Fall,
                    And we all agreed next Friday night we'd go out on the crawl

                    And we're good old boys, we come from the North Shore,
                    Drinkers and carousers the likes you've never seen;
                    And this night, by God! We drank till there was no more,
                    From the Troller to the Raven with all stops in between

                    Well we planned to have a gay old time, the cash we did not spare,
                    We left all the cars at home and paid the taxi fare;
                    I got out to Horseshoe Bay a little after five,
                    From a table in the corner I heard familiar voices rise

                    And we're good old boys, we come from the North Shore,
                    Drinkers and carousers the likes you've never seen;
                    And this night, by God! We drank till there was no more,
                    From the Troller to the Raven with all stops in between

                    Well spirits they ran high that night, old stories we did share,
                    Of the days when we were younger men and never had a care;
                    And the beer flowed like a river and we drank the keg near dry,
                    So we drained down all our glasses and were thirsty by-and-by

                    And we're good old boys, we come from the North Shore,
                    Drinkers and carousers the likes you've never seen;
                    And this night, by God! We drank till there was no more,
                    From the Troller to the Raven with all stops in between

                    Park Royal Hotel, The Rusty Gull, Square-Rigger and Queen's Cross,
                    We'd started out with eight good boys but half had gotten lost;
                    And you'll never keep the lads together when their eyes begin to rove,
                    And there was just the three of us that made it to Deep Cove

                    And we're good old boys, we come from the North Shore,
                    Drinkers and carousers the likes you've never seen;
                    And this night, by God! We drank till there was no more,
                    From the Troller to the Raven with all stops in between

                    We arrived out at The Raven just in time for the last call,
                    The final destination of this the first annual crawl;
                    We dug deep into our pockets there was no money to be found,
                    Nine miles home and for walking we are bound

                    And we're good old boys, we come from the North Shore,
                    Drinkers and carousers the likes you've never seen;
                    And this night, by God! We drank till there was no more,
                    From the Troller to the Raven with all stops in between

                    And we're good old boys, we come from the North Shore,
                    Drinkers and carousers the likes you've never seen;
                    And this night, by God! We drank till there was no more,

                    I want you to want me
                    I need you to need me
                    I'd love you to love me
                    I'm begging you to beg me
                    I want you to want me
                    I want you to want me
                    I want you to want me

                    First thing we'd climb a tree and maybe then we'd talk
                    Or sit silently and listen to our thoughts
                    With illusions of someday casting a golden light
                    No dress rehearsal, this is our life

                    And that's where the hornet stung me
                    And I had a feverish dream
                    With revenge and doubt
                    Tonight we smoke them out

                    You are ahead by a century (this is our life)
                    You are ahead by a century

                    Stare in the morning shroud and then the day began
                    I tilted your cloud, you tilted my hand
                    Rain falls in real time and rain fell through the night
                    No dress rehearsal, this is our life

                    But that's when the hornet stung me

                    You said that you'd never been

                    Will slowly fade away

                    So I'll start a revolution from my bed
                    'Cause you said the brains I had went to my head
                    Step outside, summertime's in bloom
                    Stand up beside the fireplace

                    Where nobody knows if it's night or day
                    Please don't put your life in the hands
                    Of a Rock 'n' Roll band
                    Who'll throw it all away

                    Gonna start a revolution from my bed

                    Now that she's back in the atmosphere
                    With drops of Jupiter in her hair, hey, hey, hey
                    She acts like summer and walks like rain
                    Reminds me that there's a time to change, hey, hey, hey
                    Since the return from her stay on the moon
                    She listens like spring and she talks like June, hey, hey, hey
                    Hey, hey, hey

                    But tell me, did you sail across the sun?
                    Did you make it to the Milky Way to see the lights all faded
                    And that heaven is overrated?

                    Tell me, did you fall for a shooting star–
                    One without a permanent scar?
                    And did you miss me while you were looking for yourself out there?

                    Now that she's back from that soul vacation
                    Tracing her way through the constellation, hey, hey, hey (mmm)
                    She checks out Mozart while she does tae-bo
                    Reminds me that there's room to grow, hey, hey, hey (yeah)

                    Now that she's back in the atmosphere
                    I'm afraid that she might think of me as plain ol' Jane
                    Told a story about a man who was too afraid to fly so he never did land

                    But tell me, did the wind sweep you off your feet?
                    Did you finally get the chance to dance along the light of day
                    And head back to the Milky Way?
                    And tell me, did Venus blow your mind?
                    Was it everything you wanted to find?
                    And did you miss me while you were looking for yourself out there?

                    Can you imagine no love, pride, deep-fried chicken?
                    Your best friend always sticking up for you even when I know you're wrong
                    Can you imagine no first dance, freeze dried romance, five-hour phone conversation?
                    The best soy latte that you ever had and me

                    But tell me, did the wind sweep you off your feet?
                    Did you finally get the chance to dance along the light of day
                    And head back toward the Milky Way?

                    And tell me, did you sail across the sun?
                    Did you make it to the Milky Way to see the lights all faded
                    And that heaven is overrated?

                    Na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na

                    And did you finally get the chance to dance along the light of day?

                    And did you fall for a shooting star, fall for a shooting star?
                    Na na na na na na na na na na na na na na
                    And now you're lonely looking for yourself out there.

                    i seem to recognize your face
                    haunting, familiar, yet i can't seem to place it
                    cannot find the candle of thought to light your name
                    lifetimes are catching up with me
                    all these changes taking place, i wish i'd seen the place
                    but no one's ever taken me
                    hearts and thoughts they fade, fade away... 
                    hearts and thoughts they fade, fade away... 
                    i swear i recognize your breath
                    memories like fingerprints are slowly raising
                    me, you wouldn't recall, for i'm not my former
                    it's hard when, you're stuck upon the shelf
                    i changed by not changing at all, small town predicts my fate
                    perhaps that's what no one wants to see
                    i just want to scream...hello...
                    my god its been so long, never dreamed you'd return
                    but now here you are, and here i am
                    hearts and thoughts they fade...away...
                    hearts and thoughts they fade...away...
                    hearts and thoughts they fade, fade away...
                    hearts and thoughts they fade...

                    I thought I'd try to sit down and write you that song
                    and let you in on what I've been thinking
                    I started in, but got stuck again
                    knowin' that it'd turn out wrong

                    I pushed on through, forcing the issue
                    hoping you would forgive my mistakes
                    with every song that ever turned out wrong
                    coming back to haunt the page

                    if there ever comes that day, when I know what I want to say
                    but its a mystery, especially to me

                    I got partway, still with nothing to say
                    with every thought, locked up tight in my head
                    with every doubt, that I can't work out
                    stopping me from going on

                    chorus

                    So I gave up, knowing I'd failed you again

                    for all my sins, I'm alone again

                    there was a decorated general with
                    a heart of gold, that likened him to
                    all the stories he told
                    of past battles, won and lost, and
                    legends of old a seasoned veteran in
                    his own time

                    on the battlefield, he gained
                    respectful fame with many medals
                    of bravery and stripes to his name
                    he grew a beard as soon as he could
                    to cover the scars on his face
                    and always urged his men on

                    but on the eve of a great battle
                    with the infantry in dream
                    the old general tossed in his sleep
                    and wrestled with its meaning
                    he awoke from the night
                    just to tell what he had seen
                    and walked slowly out of his tent

                    all the men held tall with their
                    chests in the air, with courage in
                    their blood and a fire in their stare
                    it was a grey morning and they all
                    wondered how they would fare
                    till the old general told them to go home

                    [CHORUS:]
                    He said: I have seen the others
                    and I have discovered
                    that this fight is not worth fighting
                    I have seen their mothers
                    and I will no other
                    to follow me where I'm going

                    So,take a shower, shine your shoes
                    you got no time to lose
                    you are young men you must be living
                    Take a shower, shine your shoes
                    you got no time to lose
                    you are young men you must be living
                    go now you are forgiven

                    but the men stood fast with their
                    guns on their shoulders not knowing
                    what to do with the contradicting orders
                    the general said he would do his own
                    duty but would extend it no further
                    the men could go as they pleased

                    but not a man moved, their eyes gazed straight ahead
                    till one by one
                    they stepped back and not a word was said
                    and the old general was left with his
                    own words echoing in his head
                    he then prepared to fight

                    [CHORUS]

                    go now you are forgiven

                    Forward yesterday
                    Makes me wanna stay
                    What they said was real
                    Makes me wanna steal
                    Livin' under house
                    Guess I'm livin', I'm a mouse
                    All's I gots is time
                    Got no meaning, just a rhyme

                    Take time with a wounded hand
                    'Cause it likes to heal
                    Take time with a wounded hand
                    'Cause I like to steal
                    Take time with a wounded hand
                    'Cause it likes to heal, I like to steal

                    I'm half the man I used to be
                    This I feel as the dawn
                    It fades to gray
                    Well, I'm half the man I used to be
                    This I feel as the dawn
                    It fades to gray
                    Well, I'm half the man I used to be
                    This I feel as the dawn
                    It fades to gray
                    Well, I'm half the man I used to be, half the man I used to be

                    Feelin' uninspired
                    Think I'll start a fire
                    Everybody run
                    Bobby's got a gun
                    Think you're kinda neat
                    Then she tells me I'm a creep
                    Friends don't mean a thing
                    Guess I'll leave it up to me

                    Take time with a wounded hand
                    'Cause it likes to heal
                    Take time with a wounded hand
                    Guess I like to steal
                    Take time with a wounded hand

                    Oh, Johnny wishes he was famous
                    Spends his time alone 
                    In the basement
                    With Lennon and Cobain
                    A guitar and a stereo
                    While he wishes he 
                    Could escape this
                    It all seems so contagious
                    Not to be yourself and faceless
                    In a song that has no soul

                    [Chorus:]
                    I remember feeling low
                    I remember losing hope
                    I remember all the feelings
                    And the day they stopped
                    We are, 
                    We are all innocent, we are all innocent

                    Oh, Tina’s losing faith in what she knows
                    Hates her music 
                    Hates all of her clothes
                    Thinks of surgery
                    And a new nose
                    Every calorie is a war
                    While she wishes she 
                    Was a dancer
                    And that she'd never 
                    Heard of cancer
                    She wishes God would give her
                    Some answers
                    And make her feel beautiful

                    [Chorus]

                    One day
                    You'll have to let it go,
                    Oh
                    One day 
                    You'll stand up on your own, you'll stand up on your own
                    Yeah
                    Remember losing hope, 
                    Remember feeling low, 
                    Remember all the feelings and the day they stopped

                    We are,

                    Jesus hangs behind the glass
                    Above Venetian doors
                    His window box boasts crimson flowers
                    Fresh cut the day before

                    And you couldn't find a smile
                    If you nailed it to his face
                    But Jesus Christ hangs his head with grace

                    And if Venice is sinking
                    I'm going under
                    'Cause beauty's religion
                    And its Christened me with wonder

                    They come in bent-backed
                    Creaking 'cross the floor all dressed in black
                    Candles, thick as pillars
                    You can buy one off the floor
                    And the ceiling's painted gold
                    Mary's hair is red
                    The old come here to kiss their dead

                    And if Venice is sinking
                    I'm going under
                    'Cause beauty's religion
                    And its Christened me with wonder

                    We made love upon a bed
                    That sagged down to the floor
                    In a room that had a postcard on the door
                    Of Marini's Little Man
                    With an erection on a horse
                    It always leaves me laughing
                    Leaves me feeling that of course if

                    Venice is sinking
                    I'm going under
                    'Cause beauty's religion
                    And its Christened me with wonder

                    love I get so lost, sometimes
                    days pass and this emptiness fills my heart
                    when I want to run away
                    I drive off in my car
                    but whichever way I go
                    I come back to the place you are

                    all my instincts, they return
                    and the grand facade, so soon will burn
                    without a noise, without my pride
                    I reach out from the inside

                    in your eyes
                    the light the heat
                    in your eyes

                    in your eyes
                    I see the light and the heat

                    oh, I want to be that complete
                    I want to touch the light
                    the heat I see in your eyes

                    love, I don't like to see so much pain
                    so much wasted and this moment keeps slipping away
                    I get so tired of working so hard for our survival
                    I look to the time with you to keep me awake and alive

                    and all my instincts, they return
                    and the grand facade, so soon will burn

                    It's amazing
                    How you make your face just like a wall
                    How you take your heart and turn it off
                    How I turn my head and lose it all

                    It's unnerving
                    How just one move puts me by myself
                    There you go just trusting someone else
                    Now I know I put us both through hell

                    I'm not saying there wasn't nothing wrong
                    I just didn't think you'd ever get tired of me
                    I'm now saying we ever had the right to hold on
                    I just didn't wanna let it get away from me

                    But if that's how it's gonna leave
                    Straight out from underneath
                    Then we'll see who's sorry now
                    If that's how it's gonna stand, when
                    You know you've been depending on
                    The one you're leaving now
                    The one you're leaving out

                    It's aggravating
                    How you threw me on and you tore me out
                    How your good intentions turn to doubt
                    The way you needed time to sort it out

                    I'm not saying there wasn't nothing wrong
                    I just didn't think you'd ever get tired of me
                    I'm now saying we ever had the right to hold on
                    I just didn't wanna let it get away from me

                    The one you're leaving now
                    The one you're leaving out

                    I'm not saying there wasn't nothing wrong
                    I just didn't think you'd ever get tired of me

                    Tell me is that how it's going to end
                    When you know you've been depending on
                    The one you're leaving now
                    And the one you're leaving out

                    The one you're leaving now
                    The one you're leaving out

                    Live a life less ordinary
                    Live a life extraordinary with me
                    Live a life less sedentary
                    Live a life evolutionary with me
                    Well I hate to be a bother,
                    But it's you and there's no other, I do believe
                    You can call me naive but...
                    I know me very well (at least as far as I can tell)
                    And I know what I need

                    The night you came into my life
                    Well it took the bones of me, took the bones of me
                    You blew away my storm and strife
                    And shook the bones of me, shook the bones of me
                    By the way, I do know why you stayed away... 
                    I will keep tongue-tied next time

                    Live a life less ordinary
                    Live a life extraordinary with me
                    My face had said too much
                    Before our hands could even touch
                    To greet a 'hello'
                    (So much for going slow...)
                    A little later on that year
                    I told you that I loved you dear
                    What do you know?
                    This you weren't prepared to hear
                    I'm a saddened man, I'm a broken boy
                    I'm a toddler with a complex toy
                    I've fallen apart, since the ambush of your heart

                    The night you came into my life
                    Well it took the bones of me, took the bones of me
                    You blew away my storm and strife
                    And shook the bones of me, shook the bones of me.
                    By the way, I do know why you stayed away
                    I will keep tongue-tied but...

                    Honey understand, honey understand
                    I won't make demands
                    Honey understand, honey understand
                    We could walk without a plan.
                    Honey understand (honey), honey understand
                    I won't rest in stone all alone
                    Honey understand, honey understand
                    I'm all ready to go
                    But you already know...

                    Live a life less ordinary
                    Live a life extraordinary with me.
                    If I could name you in this song
                    Would it make you smile and sing along?
                    This is the goal: to get into your soul
                    If I could make you dance for joy
                    Could that be the second-chance decoy?
                    The bird-in-hand I would need
                    To help you understand?

                    The night you came into my life
                    well it took the bones of me, took the bones of me
                    You blew away my storm and strife
                    And shook the bones of me, shook the bones of me
                    By the way, I do know why you stayed away

                    looking down on empty streets, all she can see
                    are the dreams all made solid
                    are the dreams all made real

                    all of the buildings, all of those cars
                    were once just a dream
                    in somebody's head

                    she pictures the broken glass, she pictures the steam
                    she pictures a soul
                    with no leak at the seam

                    lets take the boat out
                    wait until darkness
                    let's take the boat out
                    wait until darkness comes

                    nowhere in the corridors of pale green and grey
                    nowhere in the suburbs
                    in the cold light of day

                    there in the midst of it so alive and alone
                    words support like bone

                    dreaming of mercy st.
                    wear your inside out
                    dreaming of mercy
                    in your daddy('s arms again
                    dreaming of mercy st.
                    'swear they moved that sign
                    dreaming of mercy
                    in your daddy's arms

                    pulling out the papers from the drawers that slide smooth
                    tugging at the darkness, word upon word

                    confessing all the secret things in the warm velvet box
                    to the priest-he's the doctor
                    he can handle the shocks

                    dreaming of the tenderness-the tremble in the hips
                    of kissing Mary's lips

                    dreaming of mercy st.
                    wear your insides out
                    dreaming of mercy
                    in your daddy's arms again
                    dreaming of mercy st.
                    'swear they moved that sign
                    looking for mercy
                    in your daddy's arms

                    mercy, mercy, looking for mercy
                    mercy, mercy, looking for mercy

                    Anne, with her father is out in the boat
                    riding the water
                    riding the waves on the sea

                    So long ago, I don't remember when
                    That's when they say I lost my only friend
                    Well they said she died easy of a broken heart disease
                    As I listened through the cemetery trees

                    I seen the sun comin' up at the funeral at dawn
                    The long broken arm of human law
                    Now it always seemed such a waste
                    She always had a pretty face
                    So I wondered how she hung around this place

                    [сhorus:]
                    Hey, come on try a little
                    Nothing is forever
                    There's got to be something better than 
                    In the middle
                    But me & Cinderella
                    We put it all together
                    We can drive it home
                    With one headlight

                    She said it's cold
                    It feels like Independence Day
                    And I can't break away from this parade
                    But there's got to be an opening
                    Somewhere here in front of me
                    Through this maze of ugliness and greed
                    And I seen the sun up ahead
                    At the county line bridge
                    Sayin' all there's good and nothingness is dead
                    We'll run until she's out of breath
                    She ran until there's nothin' left
                    She hit the end-it's just her window ledge

                    [chorus]

                    Well this place is old
                    It feels just like a beat up truck
                    I turn the engine, but the engine doesn't turn
                    Well it smells of cheap wine & cigarettes
                    This place is always such a mess
                    Sometimes I think I'd like to watch it burn
                    I'm so alone, and I feel just like somebody else
                    Man, I ain't changed, but I know I ain't the same
                    But somewhere here in between the city walls of dyin' dreams
                    I think her death it must be killin' me

                    I wonder what it's like to be the rainmaker 
                    I wonder what it's like to know that I make the rain 
                    I'd store it in boxes with little yellow tags on everyone 
                    And you can come see them when I'm...done, when I'm 
                    Done

                    Strange, where were you, when we started this gig, 
                    I wish the real world, would just stop hassling me 

                    I wonder what it's like to be the head honcho

                    I'd shout out an order, I think we're out of this man get 
                    me some

                    Just three miles from the rest stop
                    And she slams on the breaks
                    She said I tried to be but I'm not
                    And could you please collect your things
                    I don't wanna be cold
                    I don't wanna be cruel
                    But I gotta find more
                    Than what's happening with you
                    If you'd - open up the door

                    It came to mind that I didn't care
                    So I thought - hell if it's over
                    I had better end it quick
                    Or I could lose my nerve

                    I could barely see her face
                    But she knew all the words that I never had said
                    She knew the crumpled-up promise of this
                    Broken down man - and as I opened up the door

                    She said - while you were sleeping

                    Last time I talked to you
                    You were lonely and out of place
                    You were looking down on me
                    Lost out in space
                    We laid underneath the stars
                    Strung out and feeling brave
                    I watched the red orange glow
                    I watched you float away
                    Down here in the atmosphere
                    Garbage and city lights
                    You've gone to save your tired soul
                    You've gone to save our lives
                    I turned on the radio
                    To find you on satellite
                    I’m waiting for this sky to fall
                    I’m waiting for a sign
                    All we are
                    Is all so far

                    You're falling back to me
                    You're a star that I can see
                    I know you're out there
                    Somewhere out there
                    You're falling out of reach
                    Defying gravity
                    I know you're out there
                    Somewhere out there

                    and need a change

                    I miss the way you taste
                    I know you'll come back someday
                    On a bed of nails I’ll wait
                    I’m praying that you don’t burn out
                    Or fade away

                    Is all so far

                    Green light, Seven Eleven 
                    You stop in for a pack of cigarettes 
                    You don't smoke, don't even want to 
                    Hey now, check your change 
                    Dressed up like a car crash 
                    Your wheels are turning but you're upside down 
                    You say when he hits you, you don't mind 
                    Because when he hurts you, you feel alive 
                    Hey babe, is that what it is 

                    Red lights, gray morning 
                    You stumble out of a hole in the ground 
                    A vampire or a victim 
                    It depend's on who's around 
                    You used to stay in to watch the adverts 
                    You could lip synch to the talk shows 

                    And if you look, you look through me 
                    And when you talk, you talk at me 
                    And when I touch you, you don't feel a thing 

                    If I could stay... 
                    Then the night would give you up 
                    Stay...and the day would keep its trust 
                    Stay...and the night would be enough 

                    Faraway, so close 
                    Up with the static and the radio 
                    With satelite television 
                    You can go anywhere 
                    Miami, New Orleans 
                    London, Belfast and Berlin 

                    And if you listen I can't call 
                    And if you jump, you just might fall 
                    And if you shout, I'll only hear you 

                    If I could stay... 
                    Then the night would give you up 
                    Stay...then the day would keep its trust 
                    Stay...with the demons you drowned 
                    Stay...with the spirit I found 
                    Stay...and the night would be enough 

                    Three o'clock in the morning 
                    It's quiet and there's no one around 
                    Just the bang and the clatter 
                    As an angel runs to ground 

                    Just the bang 
                    And the clatter 
                    As an angel 
                    Hits the ground

                    I tried to discover a little something to make me sweeter
                    Oh baby refrain from breaking my heart
                    I'm so in love with you
                    I'll be forever blue
                    That you give me no reason, you know you're making me work so hard
                    That you give me no . . . Soul
                    I hear you calling
                    Oh baby please give a little respect to me.

                    And if I should falter, would you open your arms out to me? 
                    We can make love not war, and live in peace with our hearts
                    I'm so in love with you, I'll be forever blue
                    What religion or reason could drive a man to forsake his lover? 
                    Don't you tell me no. . . Soul. 
                    I hear you calling
                    Oh baby please, give a little respect to me.

                    I'm so in love with you
                    I'll be forever blue

                    Friday night I'm going nowhere
                    All the lights are changing green to red
                    Turning over TV stations
                    Situations running through my head
                    Well looking back through time
                    You know it's clear that I've been blind
                    I've been a fool
                    To ever open up my heart
                    To all that jealousy, that bitterness, that ridicule

                    Saturday I'm running wild
                    And all the lights are changing red to green
                    Moving through the crowd I'm pushing
                    Chemicals all rushing through my bloodstream
                    Only wish that you were here
                    You know I'm seeing it so clear
                    I've been afraid
                    To tell you how I really feel
                    Admit to some of those bad mistakes I've made

                    If you want it
                    Come and get it
                    Crying out loud
                    The love that I was
                    Giving you was
                    Never in doubt
                    Let go your heart
                    Let go your head
                    And feel it now

                    Babylon, Babylon

                    Sunday all the lights of London
                    Shining , Sky is fading red to blue
                    I'm kicking through the Autumn leaves
                    And wondering where it is you might be going to
                    Turning back for home
                    You know I'm feeling so alone
                    I can't believe
                    Climbing on the stair
                    I turn around to see you smiling there
                    In front of me

                    If you want it
                    Come and get it
                    Crying out loud
                    The love that I was
                    Giving you was
                    Never in doubt
                    And feel it now
                    Let go your heart
                    Let go your head
                    And feel it now
                    Let go your heart
                    Let go your head
                    And feel it now
                    Let go your heart
                    Let go your head
                    And feel it now
                    Let go your heart
                    Let go your head
                    And feel it now

                    If you twist and turn away
                    If you tear yourself in two again
                    If I could, yes I would
                    If I could, I would

                    If I could throw this lifeless lifeline to the wind
                    Leave this heart of clay
                    See you walk, walk away

                    Into the half-light
                    And through the flame

                    If I could through myself
                    Set your spirit free, I'd lead your heart away
                    See you break, break away
                    Into the light
                    And to the day

                    Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
                    Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
                    To let it go
                    And so to fade away
                    To let it go
                    And so, fade away

                    Wide awake
                    I'm wide awake
                    Wide awake
                    I'm not sleeping
                    Oh, no, no, no

                    If you should ask then maybe they'd
                    Tell you what I would say
                    True colors fly in blue and black
                    Bruised silken sky and burning flag
                    Colors crash, collide in bloodshot eyes

                    Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
                    If I could, you know I would, if I could, I would
                    Let it go

                    This desperation
                    Dislocation
                    Separation, condemnation
                    Revelation in temptation
                    Isolation, desolation
                    Let it go

                    And so fade away
                    To let it go
                    And so fade away
                    To let it go
                    Oh now, and so to fade away

                    I'm wide awake

                    Drink up baby, stay up all night
                    With the things you could do
                    You won't but you might
                    The potential you'll be
                    That you'll never see
                    The promises you'll only make

                    Drink up with me now
                    And forget all about
                    The pressure of days
                    Do what I say
                    And I'll make you okay
                    And drive them away

                    People you've been before
                    That you don't want around anymore
                    That push and shove and won't bend to your will
                    I'll keep them still

                    Drink up baby, look at the stars
                    I'll kiss you again between the bars
                    Where I'm seeing you there
                    With your hands in the air
                    Waiting to finally be caught

                    Drink up one more time
                    And I'll make you mine
                    Keep you apart,
                    Deep in my heart
                    Separate from the rest,
                    Where I like you the best
                    And keep the things you forgot

                    The people you've been before
                    That you don't want around anymore
                    That push and shove and won't bend to your will

                    You took your suitcase, I took the blame.
                    Now I'm tryna make sense of what little remains, ooh

                    Lately I've been, I've been losing sleep
                    Dreaming about the things that we could be
                    But, baby I've been, I've been praying hard
                    Said no more counting dollars, we'll be counting stars
                    Yeah, we'll be counting stars

                    I see this life like a swinging vine,
                    Swing my heart across the line
                    In my face is flashing signs,
                    Seek it out and ye shall find.

                    Old but I'm not that old
                    Young but I'm not that bold
                    And I don't think the world is sold
                    I'm just doing what we're told

                    I I I I feel something so right by doing the wrong thing
                    And I I I I feel something so wrong by doing the right thing

                    I could lie, couldn't I, couldn't I?
                    Every thing that kills me makes me feel alive.

                    Lately I've been, I've been losing sleep
                    Dreaming about the things that we could be
                    Baby I've been, I've been praying hard
                    Said no more counting dollars, we'll be counting stars
                    Lately I've been, I've been losing sleep
                    Dreaming about the things that we could be
                    But, baby I've been, I've been praying hard
                    Said no more counting dollars, we'll be-we'll be counting stars

                    Ye-e-yeah

                    I feel her love
                    And I feel it burn down this river every time
                    Hope is our four-letter word, make that money watch it burn

                    Old but, I'm not that old
                    Young, but I'm not that bold
                    And I don't think the world is sold
                    I'm just doing what we're told

                    And I I I I feel something so wrong by doing the right thing
                    I could lie, couldn't I, couldn't I?
                    Everything that drowns me makes me wanna fly

                    Lately I've been, I've been losing sleep
                    Dreaming about the things that we could be
                    Baby I've been, I've been praying hard
                    Said no more counting dollars, we'll be counting stars
                    Lately I've been, I've been losing sleep

                    Said no more counting dollars, we'll be-we'll be counting stars

                    Oh, take that money watch it burn,
                    Sing in the river the lessons I learned
                    Take that money watch it burn,
                    Sing in the river the lessons I learned
                    Take that money watch it burn,
                    Sing in the river the lessons I learned
                    Take that money watch it burn,

                    Just a small town girl
                    Livin' in a lonely world
                    She took the midnight train
                    Goin' anywhere
                    Just a city boy
                    Born and raised in South Detroit
                    He took the midnight train
                    Goin' anywhere

                    A singer in a smokey room
                    The smell of wine and cheap perfume
                    For a smile they can share the night
                    It goes on and on, and on, and on

                    Strangers waiting
                    Up and down the boulevard
                    Their shadows searching
                    In the night
                    Streetlight people
                    Livin' just to find emotion
                    Hidin' somewhere in the night

                    Workin' hard to get my fill
                    Everybody wants a thrill
                    Payin' anything to roll the dice
                    Just one more time
                    Some will win
                    Some will lose
                    Some were born to sing the blues
                    Oh, the movie never ends
                    It goes on and on, and on, and on

                    Strangers waiting
                    Up and down the boulevard
                    Their shadows searching
                    In the night
                    Streetlight people
                    Livin' just to find emotion
                    Hidin' somewhere in the night

                    [Instrumental interlude]

                    Don't stop believin'
                    Hold on to that feelin'

                    That's great! It starts with an earthquake,
                    Birds and snakes, an aeroplane;
                    Lenny Bruce is not afraid.

                    Eye of a hurricane, listen to yourself churn.
                    World serves its own needs, don't mis-serve your own needs.
                    Speed it up a notch, speed, grunt, no strength.
                    The ladder starts to clatter with fear of fight, down height.
                    Wire in a fire, represent the seven games
                    In a government for hire and a combat site.
                    Left her, wasn't coming in a hurry
                    With the furies breathing down your neck.

                    Team by team reporters baffled, trump, tethered crop.
                    Look at that low plane! Fine, then.
                    Uh oh, overflow, population, common group,
                    But it'll do. Save yourself, serve yourself.
                    World serves its own needs, listen to your heart bleed.
                    Tell me with the rapture and the rev-'rent in the right, right.
                    You vitriolic, patriotic, slam, fight, bright light;
                    Feeling pretty psyched.

                    It's the end of the world as we know it.
                    It's the end of the world as we know it.
                    It's the end of the world as we know it, and I feel fine.

                    Six o'clock. TV hour.
                    Don't get caught in foreign tower.
                    Slash and burn, return,
                    Listen to yourself churn.
                    Lock him in uniform and book burning, bloodletting.
                    Ev'ry motive escalate. Automotive incinerate.
                    Light a candle, light a motive.
                    Step down, step down.
                    Watch a heel crush, crush.
                    Uh oh, this means no fear; cavalier.
                    Renegade and steer clear!
                    A tournament, a tournament,
                    A tournament of lies.
                    Offer me solutions, offer me alternatives
                    And I decline.

                    It's the end of the world as we know it
                    It's the end of the world as we know it (It's time I had some time alone)
                    It's the end of the world as we know it, and I feel fine (It's time I had some time alone)
                    I feel fine

                    It's the end of the world as we know it, and I feel fine (It's time I had some time alone)

                    The other night I tripped a nice
                    Continental drift divide.
                    Mountains sit in a line.
                    Leonard Bernstein, Leonid Brezhnev,
                    Lenny Bruce, and Lester Banks
                    Birthday party, cheesecake, jelly beans, boom!
                    You symbiotic, patriotic, slam, but neck, right? (Right!)

                    It's the end of the world as we know it (It's time I had some time alone)

                    But the way you play your game ain't fair.
                    I pity the fool
                    That falls in love with you

                    Trying to keep ya,
                    Trying to please ya.
                    'Cause being in love with your ass ain't cheap.
                    I pity the fool
                    That falls in love with you
                    (Oh shit she's a golddigger)
                    Well
                    (Just thought you should know nigga)
                    Oooooooooh

                    Ooh,
                    I really hate your ass right now.

                    I see you driving 'round town with the girl I love
                    and I'm like,
                    "FUCK YOU!"
                    Ooo,ooo,oooo
                    I guess the change in my pocket wasn't enough
                    I'm like,
                    "FUCK YOU!
                    And fuck her too."
                    I said,
                    "If I was richer, I'd still be with ya"
                    Ha, now ain't that some shit?

                    With a...

                    "This is one for your dad."
                    (Your dad, your dad, your dad)

                    Laid back [with my mind on my money and my money on my mind]

                    Now, that, I got me some Seagram's gin
                    Everybody got they cups, but they ain't chipped in

                    Everything is fine when you listenin to the D-O-G
                    I got the cultivating music that be captivating he
                    who listens, to the words that I speak
                    As I take me a drink to the middle of the street
                    and get to mackin to this bitch named Sadie (Sadie?)
                    She used to be the homeboy's lady (Oh, that bitch)
                    Eighty degrees, when I tell that bitch please
                    Raise up off these N-U-T's, cause you gets none of these
                    At ease, as I mob with the Dogg Pound, feel the breeze

                    Later on that day
                    My homey Dr. Dre came through with a gang of Tanqueray
                    And a fat ass J, of some bubonic chronic that made me choke
                    Shit, this ain't no joke
                    I had to back up off of it and sit my cup down
                    Tanqueray and chronic, yeah I'm fucked up now
                    But it ain't no stoppin, I'm still poppin
                    Dre got some bitches from the city of Compton
                    To serve me, not with a cherry on top
                    Cause when I bust my nut, I'm raisin up off the cot
                    Don't get upset girl, that's just how it goes
                    I don't love you hoes, I'm out the do'
                    And I'll be

                    Rollin down the street, smokin indo, sippin on gin and juice

                    You're keeping in step 
                    In the line 
                    Got your chin held high and you feel just fine 
                    Cause you do 
                    What you're told 
                    But inside your heart it is black and it's hollow and it's cold 

                    Just how deep do you believe? 
                    Will you bite the hand that feeds? 
                    Will you chew until it bleeds? 
                    Can you get up off your knees? 
                    Are you brave enough to see? 
                    Do you want to change it?

                    What if this whole crusade's
                    A charade
                    And behind it all there's a price to be paid
                    For the blood
                    On which we dine
                    Justified in the name of the holy and the divine

                    Just how deep do you believe?
                    Will you bite the hand that feeds?
                    Will you chew until it bleeds?
                    Can you get up off your knees?
                    Are you brave enough to see?
                    Do you want to change it?

                    So naive
                    I keep holding on to what I want to believe
                    I can see
                    But I keep holding on and on and on and on

                    [8X]
                    Will you bite the hand that feeds you?
                    Will you stay down on your knees?

                    Love of mine, some day you will die
                    But I'll be close behind
                    I'll follow you into the dark
                    No blinding light or tunnels to gates of white
                    Just our hands clasped so tight
                    Waiting for the hint of a spark

                    If Heaven and Hell decide
                    That they both are satisfied
                    Illuminate the No's on their vacancy signs
                    If there's no one beside you
                    When your soul embarks
                    Then I'll follow you into the dark

                    In Catholic school as vicious as Roman rule
                    I got my knuckles bruised by a lady in black
                    And I held my tongue as she told me,
                    "Son, fear is the heart of love."
                    So I never went back

                    If Heaven and Hell decide
                    That they both are satisfied
                    Illuminate the No's on their vacancy signs
                    If there's no one beside you
                    When your soul embarks
                    Then I'll follow you into the dark

                    You and me have seen everything to see
                    From Bangkok to Calgary
                    And the soles of your shoes are all worn down
                    The time for sleep is now
                    It's nothing to cry about
                    'Cause we'll hold each other soon
                    In the blackest of rooms

                    If Heaven and Hell decide
                    That they both are satisfied
                    Illuminate the No's on their vacancy signs
                    If there's no one beside you
                    When your soul embarks

                    Ten decisions shape your life,
                    You'll be aware of 5 about,
                    7 ways to go through school,
                    Either you're noticed or left out,
                    7 ways to get ahead,
                    7 reasons to drop out,
                    When I said 'I can see me in your eyes',
                    You said 'I can see you in my bed',
                    That's not just friendship that's romance too,
                    You like music we can dance to,

                    Sit me down,
                    Shut me up,
                    I'll calm down,
                    And I'll get along with you,

                    There is a time when we all fail,
                    Some people take it pretty well,
                    Some take it all out on themselves,
                    Some they just take it out on friends,
                    Oh everybody plays the game,
                    And if you don't you're called insane,

                    Don't don't don't don't it's not safe no more,
                    I've got to see you one more time,
                    Soon you were born,
                    In 1984,

                    Sit me down,
                    Shut me up,
                    I'll calm down,
                    And I'll get along with you,

                    Everybody was well dressed,
                    And everybody was a mess,
                    6 things without fail you must do,
                    So that your woman loves just you,
                    Oh all the girls played mental games,
                    And all the guys were dressed the same,

                    Why not try it all,
                    If you only remember it once,
                    Oooh ooooooh,

                    Sit me down,
                    Shut me up,
                    I'll calm down,
                    And I'll get along with you,

                    Here comes the helicopter -- second time today
                    Everybody scatters and hopes it goes away
                    How many kids they've murdered only God can say
                    If I had a rocket launcher...I'd make somebody pay

                    I don't believe in guarded borders and I don't believe in hate
                    I don't believe in generals or their stinking torture states
                    And when I talk with the survivors of things too sickening to relate
                    If I had a rocket launcher...I would retaliate

                    On the Rio Lacantun, one hundred thousand wait
                    To fall down from starvation -- or some less humane fate
                    Cry for guatemala, with a corpse in every gate
                    If I had a rocket launcher...I would not hesitate

                    I want to raise every voice -- at least I've got to try
                    Every time I think about it water rises to my eyes.
                    Situation desperate, echoes of the victims cry
                    If I had a rocket launcher...Some son of a bitch would die

                    And we'll dance

                    And if I'm feelin' good to you
                    And you're feelin' good to me

                    Like a lazy flowing river
                    Surrounding castles in the sky
                    And the crowd is growing bigger
                    List'nin' for the happy sounds
                    And I got to let them fly

                    Where pistons keep on churnin'
                    And the wheels go 'round and 'round
                    And the steel rails are cold and hard

                    Moving on the floor now babe you're a bird of paradise
                    Cherry ice cream smile I suppose it's very nice
                    With a step to your left and a flick to the right you catch that mirror way out west
                    You know you're something special and you look like you're the best

                    Her name is Rio and she dances on the sand
                    Just like that river twisting through a dusty land
                    And when she shines she really shows you all she can
                    Oh Rio, Rio dance across the Rio Grande

                    I've seen you on the beach and I've seen you on TV
                    Two of a billion stars it means so much to me
                    Like a birthday or a pretty view
                    But then I'm sure that you know it's just for you

                    Her name is Rio and she dances on the sand
                    Just like that river twisting through a dusty land
                    And when she shines she really shows you all she can
                    Oh Rio, Rio dance across the Rio Grande

                    Hey now woo look at that did she nearly run you down
                    At the end of the drive the lawmen arrive
                    You make me feel alive, alive alive
                    I'll take my chance cause luck is on my side or something
                    I know what you're thinking I tell you something I know what you're thinking

                    Her name is Rio and she dances on the sand
                    Just like that river twists across a dusty land
                    And when she shines she really shows you all she can
                    Oh Rio, Rio dance across the Rio Grand
                    Her name is Rio she don't need to understand
                    And I might find her if I'm looking like I can
                    Oh Rio, Rio hear them shout across the land
                    From mountains in the north down to the Rio Grande

                    Step out the front door like a ghost
                    into the fog where no one notices
                    the contrast of white on white.
                    And in between the moon and you
                    the angels get a better view
                    of the crumbling difference between wrong and right.
                    I walk in the air between the rain
                    through myself and back again
                    Where? I don't know
                    Maria says she's dying
                    through the door I hear her crying
                    Why? I don't know

                    [Chorus:]
                    Round here we always stand up straight
                    Round here something radiates

                    Maria came from Nashville with a suitcase in her hand
                    she said she'd like to meet a boy who looks like Elvis
                    and she walks along the edge of where the ocean meets the land
                    just like she's walking on a wire in the circus
                    she parks her car outside of my house
                    and takes her clothes off
                    says she's close to understanding Jesus
                    and she knows she's more than just a little misunderstood
                    she has trouble acting normal when she's nervous

                    [Chorus:]
                    Round here we're carving out our names
                    Round here we all look the same
                    Round here we talk just like lions
                    But we sacrifice like lambs
                    Round here she's slipping through my hands

                    Sleeping children better run like the wind
                    out of the lightning dream
                    Mama's little baby better get herself in
                    out of the lightning

                    She says, "It's only in my head."
                    She says, "Shh I know it's only in my head."
                    But the girl on car in the parking lot
                    says, "Man you should try to take a shot.
                    can't you see my walls are crumbling?"
                    Then she looks up at the building
                    and says she's thinking of jumping
                    She says she's tired of life
                    she must be tired of something

                    [Chorus:]
                    Round here she's always on my mind
                    Round here hey man got lots of time
                    Round here we're never sent to bed early
                    And nobody makes us wait
                    Round here we stay up very, very, very, very late

                    I can't see nothin', nothin', round here.
                    You catch me if I'm falling.
                    You catch me if I'm falling.
                    You catch me cause I'm falling down on you
                    I said, "I'm under the gun..."
                    Round here.
                    Oh, man, I said, "I'm under the gun..."
                    Round here.
                    And I can't see nothin', nothin'.
                    Round here.

                    You're number 37, have a look

                    There is freedom within
                    there is freedom without
                    Try to catch a deluge in a paper cup
                    There's a battle ahead 
                    many battles are lost
                    But you'll never see the end of the road
                    While you're traveling with me

                    [CHORUS]
                    Hey now, hey now
                    Don't dream it's over
                    Hey now, hey now
                    When the world comes in
                    They come, they come
                    To build a wall between us
                    We know they won't win

                    Now I'm towing my car
                    there's a hole in the roof
                    my possessions are causing me suspicion but there's no proof
                    in the paper today 
                    tales of war and of waste
                    but you turn right over to the T.V. page

                    [CHORUS]
                    Hey now, hey now
                    Don't dream it's over

                    When the world comes in
                    They come, they come
                    To build a wall between us
                    We know they won't win

                    Now I'm walking again 
                    to the beat of a drum
                    And I'm counting the steps to the door of your heart
                    Only shadows ahead
                    barely clearing the roof
                    Get to know the feeling of liberation and relief

                    Hey now, Hey now
                    Don't dream it's over
                    Hey now, Hey now
                    When the world comes in
                    They come, they come
                    To build a wall between us
                    You know they won't win

                    Don't let them win
                    Hey now, Hey now

                    Hey now, Hey now

                    Hey now, Hey now

                    They come, They come
                    Don't let them win

                    Hey now, Hey now (yeah)

                    Club queen on the downtown scene
                    Prowling around at night
                    You're not mean, you're just born to be seen
                    Born to be wild
                    A little party never hurt no one, that's why it's alright
                    You want in but you just can't win
                    So you hang in the lights

                    You're so Art Deco, out on the floor
                    Shining like gun metal, cold and unsure
                    Baby, you're so ghetto
                    You're looking to score
                    When they all say hello
                    You try to ignore them
                    Cause you want more (why?)

                    Rolling around at night
                    Got things, that have yet to be seen
                    Like your rapper's delight
                    A little party never hurt no one, that's why it's alright
                    You want in, but you just can't win

                    A little party never hurt no one
                    That's what your friends say
                    You put your life out on the line
                    You're crazy all the time
                    Put your life out on the line

                    Sounds like she's singin'
                    Whoo, baby, whoo
                    Said, whoo

                    And the days go by
                    Like a strand in the wind
                    In the web that is my own
                    I begin again
                    Said to my friend, baby
                    Nothin' else mattered

                    He was no more
                    (He was no more)
                    Than a baby then
                    Well, he seemed broken hearted
                    Somethin' within him
                    But the moment
                    That I first laid
                    Eyes on him
                    All alone on the edge of seventeen

                    Just like the white winged dove
                    Sings a song
                    Sounds like she's singin'
                    Whoo, baby, whoo, whoo
                    Just like the white winged dove
                    Sings a song
                    Sounds like she's singin'
                    Said, whoo, baby, whoo
                    Said, whoo

                    Well, I went today
                    Maybe I will go again
                    Tomorrow, yeah, yeah
                    Well, the music there
                    Well it was hauntingly familiar
                    When I see you doin'
                    What I try to do for me
                    With their words of a poet
                    And a voice from a choir
                    And a melody
                    Nothin' else mattered

                    Just like the white winged dove
                    Sings a song
                    Sounds like she's singin'
                    Whoo, baby, whoo, said whoo
                    Just like the white winged dove
                    Sings a song
                    Sounds like she's singin'
                    Said, whoo, baby, whoo
                    Said, whoo

                    The clouds never expect it
                    When it rains
                    But the sea changes colours
                    But the sea
                    Does not change
                    So with the slow graceful flow
                    Of age
                    I went forth with an age old
                    Desire to please
                    On the edge of seventeen

                    Just like the white winged dove

                    Just like the white winged dove
                    Sings a song
                    Sounds like she's singin'

                    Said, whoo

                    Well then suddenly
                    There was no one left standing
                    In the hall, yeah, yeah
                    In a flood of tears
                    That no one really ever heard fall at all
                    When I went searchin' for an answer
                    Up the stairs and down the hall
                    Not to find an answer
                    Just to hear the call
                    Of a nightbird singin'
                    (Come away)
                    (Come away)

                    And I hear you (and I hear you)
                    At nightfall (at nightfall)
                    Sometime to be near you
                    Is to be unable to hear you
                    My love
                    I'm a few years older than you
                    (I'm a few years older than you)

                    Just like the white winged dove
                    Sings a song
                    Sounds like she's singin'
                    Whoo, baby, whoo
                    Said, whoo

                    I was born in Macon Georgia
                    They kept my daddy over in Macon jail
                    He told me if you keep your hands clean
                    You won't hear them bloodhounds on your trail

                    Well I fell in with bad companions
                    Robbed a man, oh up in Tennessee
                    They caught me way up in Nashville
                    They locked me up and threw away the key

                    I washed my hands in muddy water
                    Washed my hands, but they didn't come clean
                    Tried to do what my daddy told me
                    But I must have washed my hands in a muddy stream

                    Well I asked the judge now when's my time up
                    He said son, oh you know we won't forget
                    If you try just to keep your hands clean
                    We might just make a good man of you yet

                    Oh I couldn't wait to get my time up
                    I broke out, broke out of Nashville jail
                    I just crossed the state-line of Georgia
                    Well I can hear those bloodhounds on my trail

                    I washed my hands in muddy water
                    Washed my hands, but they didn't come clean
                    Tried to do what my daddy told me
                    But I must have washed my hands in a muddy stream

                    March winds will blow all my troubles away.

                    I'd shine my light through cool Colorado rain.

                    Once upon a time you dressed so fine
                    You threw the bums a dime in your prime, didn't you ?
                    People'd call, say, "Beware doll, you're bound to fall."
                    You thought they were all kiddin' you
                    You used to laugh about
                    Everybody that was hangin' out
                    Now you don't talk so loud
                    Now you don't seem so proud
                    About having to be scrounging for your next meal.

                    How does it feel?
                    How does it feel
                    To be without a home
                    Like a complete unknown
                    Like a rolling stone ?

                    You've gone to the finest school all right, Miss Lonely
                    But you know you only used to get juiced in it
                    And nobody's ever taught you how to live out on the street
                    And now you're gonna have to get used to it
                    You said you'd never compromise
                    With the mystery tramp, but now you realize
                    He's not selling any alibis
                    As you stare into the vacuum of his eyes
                    And say do you want to make a deal?

                    How does it feel?
                    How does it feel
                    To be on your own
                    With no direction home
                    A complete unknown
                    Like a rolling stone ?

                    You never turned around to see the frowns on the jugglers and the clowns
                    When they all come down and did tricks for you
                    You never understood that it ain't no good
                    You shouldn't let other people get your kicks for you
                    You used to ride on the chrome horse with your diplomat
                    Who carried on his shoulder a Siamese cat
                    Ain't it hard when you discover that
                    He really wasn't where it's at
                    After he took from you everything he could steal.

                    How does it feel?
                    How does it feel
                    To be on your own
                    With no direction home
                    Like a complete unknown
                    Like a rolling stone ?

                    Princess on the steeple and all the pretty people
                    They're all drinkin', thinkin' that they got it made
                    Exchanging all precious gifts
                    But you'd better take your diamond ring, you'd better pawn it babe
                    You used to be so amused
                    At Napoleon in rags and the language that he used
                    Go to him now, he calls you, you can't refuse
                    When you ain't got nothing, you got nothing to lose
                    You're invisible now, you got no secrets to conceal.

                    How does it feel
                    How does it feel
                    To be on your own
                    With no direction home
                    Like a complete unknown
                    Like a rolling stone ?

                    (In constant sorrow through his days)

                    I am a man of constant sorrow
                    I've seen trouble all my day
                    I bid farewell to old Kentucky
                    The place where I was born and raised

                    The place where he was born and raised

                    For six long years I've been in trouble
                    No pleasures here on earth I found
                    For in this world I'm bound to ramble
                    I have no friends to help me now

                    He has no friends to help him now

                    It's fare thee well my old lover
                    I never expect to see you again
                    For I'm bound to ride that northern railroad
                    Perhaps I'll die upon this train

                    Perhaps he'll die upon this train

                    You can bury me in some deep valley
                    For many years where I may lay
                    Then you may learn to love another
                    While I am sleeping in my grave

                    While he is sleeping in his grave

                    Maybe your friends think I'm just a stranger
                    My face you'll never see no more
                    But there is one promise that is given
                    I'll meet you on God's golden shore

                    He'll meet you on God's golden shore

                    It's only in your head you feel left out or looked down on.
                    Just try your best, try everything you can.

                    Everything, everything will be just fine,
                    Everything, everything will be alright, alright.

                    Hey, you know they're all the same.
                    You know you're doing better on your own (on your own), so don't buy in.
                    Live right now, yeah, just be yourself.
                    It doesn't matter if it's good enough (good enough) for someone else.

                    Everything, everything will be just fine,
                    Everything, everything will be alright, alright.
                    It just takes some time,
                    Little girl, you're in the middle of the ride.
                    Everything, everything will be just fine,
                    Everything, everything will be alright, alright.

                    Hey, don't write yourself off yet.
                    It's only in your head you feel left out or looked down on.
                    Just do your best (just do your best), do everything you can (do everything you can).
                    And don't you worry what the bitter hearts are gonna say.

                    It just takes some time,
                    Little girl, you're in the middle of the ride.
                    Everything, everything will be just fine,
                    Everything, everything will be alright, alright.
                    It just takes some time,
                    Little girl, you're in the middle of the ride.
                    Everything, everything will be just fine,
                    Everything, everything will be alright.

                    I'm coming out of my cage
                    And I've been doing just fine
                    Gotta gotta be down
                    Because I want it all

                    It started out with a kiss
                    How did it end up like this?
                    It was only a kiss
                    It was only a kiss

                    Now I'm falling asleep
                    And she's calling a cab
                    While he's having a smoke
                    And she's taking a drag

                    Now they're going to bed
                    And my stomach is sick
                    And it's all in my head

                    But she's touching his chest now
                    He takes off her dress now
                    Let me go

                    And I just can't look it's killing me
                    And taking control

                    Jealousy, turning saints into the sea
                    Swimming through sick lullabies
                    Choking on your alibis

                    But it's just the price I pay
                    Destiny is calling me
                    Open up my eager eyes
                    'Cause I'm Mr Brightside

                    I'm coming out of my cage

                    Love me now while we're alive
                    It's the best thing we can do
                    We'll have no time upon Cloud Nine
                    So Heaven on Earth will have to do
                    I can sing like a bird
                    And dance like a demon
                    And I do it all so well
                    'Cause I made a deal with the Devil
                    And when I die
                    I'm going Straight to Hell
                    Oh Yeah
                    I'm going Straight to Hell

                    Standing at the Crossroads
                    He offered wine women and song
                    Riches, Fame and Fortune
                    In my hands from that day on
                    I was granted there and then
                    A life of Rock and Roll
                    It seemed like such a bargain
                    For just one eternal soul
                    I know I'll curse this damned decision
                    And I'll regret it the moment I fall
                    But I'll be making the most
                    of a bad situation
                    Till my number is called

                    Sometimes I swear I've come out on top
                    In this ill conceived contract
                    There's nights I say
                    it's a small price to pay
                    For the life and times I've had
                    I think "Here's to the Gents and Ladies
                    And the foolish times we spent
                    They cost me Afterlife in Paradise
                    And they were worth every single cent"
                    So have a dance
                    with the walking damned
                    Before my time is done
                    A deal is a deal and I really doubt
                    Fire and Brimstone will be much fun

                    I have every expectation
                    That my final prayers will go unheard
                    And my veiled death bed confession
                    Will not move the Mighty Lord
                    I'm sure that I'll be sorry
                    When he slams St. Peter's Gate
                    But I'll dive right into damnation
                    With a smile across my face

                    I've been a wild rover for many's a year,
                    And I've spent all my money on whiskey and beer
                    And now I'm returning with gold in great store,
                    And I never will play the wild rover no more

                    And it's no, nay, never!
                    No nay never no more
                    And I'll play the wild rover,
                    No never no more

                    I went to an alehouse I used to frequent,
                    And I told the landlady my money was spent
                    I asked her for credit, she answered me, "Nay",
                    Saying, "Custom like yours I can have any day"

                    And it's no, nay, never!
                    No nay never no more
                    And I'll play the wild rover,
                    No never no more

                    I took from my pocket ten sovereigns bright,
                    And the landlady's eyes opened wide with delight
                    She said, "I have whiskeys and wines of the best,
                    And the words that I told you were only in jest"

                    And it's no, nay, never!
                    No nay never no more
                    And I'll play the wild rover,
                    No never no more

                    I'll go home to my parents, confess what I've done,
                    And I'll ask them to pardon their prodigal son
                    And when they have kissed me as oft-times before,
                    I never will play the wild rover no more

                    And it's no, nay, never!
                    No nay never no more
                    And I'll play the wild rover,

                    And we were gettin' dry
                    Almost let a pick-up truck nearly pass us by
                    So we jumped right in and the driver grinned
                    v:
                    And he dropped us up the road
                    Yeah, we looked at the swim and we jumped right in
                    Not to mention fishing poles
                    pc:
                    Oh, the water
                    Oh, the water
                    Oh, the water
                    Let it run all over me
                    c:
                    And it stoned me to my soul
                    Stoned me just like Jelly Roll
                    And it stoned me
                    And it stoned me to my soul
                    Stoned me just like goin' home
                    And it stoned me
                    v:
                    On the way back home we sang a song
                    But our throats were getting dry
                    Then we saw the man from across the road
                    With the sunshine in his eyes
                    v:
                    Well he lived all alone in his own little home
                    With a great big gallon jar
                    There were bottles too, one for me and you
                    And he said Hey! There you are
                    pc:
                    Oh, the water
                    Oh, the water
                    Oh, the water
                    Get it myself from the mountain stream
                    c:
                    And it stoned me to my soul
                    Stoned me just like Jelly Roll
                    And it stoned me
                    And it stoned me to my soul
                    Stoned me just like goin' home
                    And it stoned me
                    c:
                    And it stoned me to my soul
                    Stoned me just like Jelly Roll
                    And it stoned me
                    And it stoned me to my soul
                    Stoned me just like goin' home

                    Too late to beg you or cancel it

                    When you're on a holiday
                    You can't find the words to say
                    All the things that come to you
                    And I wanna feel it too

                    On an island in the sun
                    We'll be playing and having fun
                    And it makes me feel so fine

                    Just a place to call your own
                    As we drift into the zone

                    On an island in the sun
                    We'll be playing and having fun
                    And it makes me feel so fine
                    I can't control my brain

                    We'll run away together
                    We'll spend some time forever
                    We'll never feel bad anymore

                    Step one, you say, "We need to talk."
                    He walks, you say, "Sit down. It's just a talk."
                    He smiles politely back at you
                    You stare politely right on through
                    Some sort of window to your right
                    As he goes left and you stay right
                    Between the lines of fear and blame
                    You begin to wonder why you came

                    Where did I go wrong? I lost a friend
                    Somewhere along in the bitterness
                    And I would have stayed up with you all night
                    Had I known how to save a life

                    Let him know that you know best
                    'Cause after all you do know best
                    Try to slip past his defense
                    Without granting innocence
                    Lay down a list of what is wrong
                    The things you've told him all along
                    Pray to God, he hears you
                    And I pray to God, he hears you

                    And where did I go wrong? I lost a friend
                    Somewhere along in the bitterness
                    And I would have stayed up with you all night
                    Had I known how to save a life

                    As he begins to raise his voice
                    You lower yours and grant him one last choice
                    Drive until you lose the road
                    Or break with the ones you've followed
                    He will do one of two things
                    He will admit to everything
                    Or he'll say he's just not the same
                    And you'll begin to wonder why you came

                    Where did I go wrong? I lost a friend
                    Somewhere along in the bitterness
                    And I would have stayed up with you all night

                    On a dark desert highway, cool wind in my hair
                    Warm smell of colitas, rising up through the air
                    Up ahead in the distance, I saw a shimmering light
                    My head grew heavy and my sight grew dim
                    I had to stop for the night
                    There she stood in the doorway;
                    I heard the mission bell
                    And I was thinking to myself,
                    "This could be Heaven or this could be Hell"
                    Then she lit up a candle and she showed me the way
                    There were voices down the corridor,
                    I thought I heard them say...

                    Welcome to the Hotel California
                    Such a lovely place (Such a lovely place)
                    Such a lovely face
                    Plenty of room at the Hotel California
                    Any time of year (Any time of year)
                    You can find it here

                    Her mind is Tiffany-twisted, she got the Mercedes bends
                    She got a lot of pretty, pretty boys she calls friends
                    How they dance in the courtyard, sweet summer sweat.
                    Some dance to remember, some dance to forget

                    So I called up the Captain,
                    "Please bring me my wine"
                    He said, "We haven't had that spirit here since nineteen sixty nine"
                    And still those voices are calling from far away,
                    Wake you up in the middle of the night
                    Just to hear them say...

                    Welcome to the Hotel California
                    Such a lovely place (Such a lovely place)
                    Such a lovely face
                    They livin' it up at the Hotel California
                    What a nice surprise (what a nice surprise)
                    Bring your alibis

                    Mirrors on the ceiling,
                    The pink champagne on ice
                    And she said "We are all just prisoners here, of our own device"
                    And in the master's chambers,
                    They gathered for the feast
                    They stab it with their steely knives,
                    But they just can't kill the beast

                    Last thing I remember, I was
                    Running for the door
                    I had to find the passage back
                    To the place I was before
                    "Relax, " said the night man,
                    "We are programmed to receive.
                    You can check-out any time you like,
                    But you can never leave! "

                    I like the way your sparkling earrings lay,
                    Against your skin, it's so brown.
                    And I wanna sleep with you in the desert tonight
                    With a billion stars all around.

                    'Cause I got a peaceful easy feeling,
                    And I know you won't let me down
                    'cause I'm already standing on the ground.

                    And I found out a long time ago
                    What a woman can do to your soul.
                    Oh, but she can't take you anyway,
                    You don't already know how to go.

                    And I got a peaceful easy feeling,
                    And I know you won't let me down
                    'cause I'm already standing on the ground.

                    I get this feeling I may know you as a lover and a friend.
                    But this voice keeps whispering in my other ear,
                    Tells me I may never see you again.

                    'cause I get a peaceful easy feeling
                    And I know you won't let me down
                    'cause I'm already standing...
                    I'm already standing...
                    Yes, I'm already standing on the ground

                    She was more like a beauty queen from a movie scene
                    I said don't mind, but what do you mean I am the one
                    Who will dance on the floor in the round
                    She said I am the one who will dance on the floor in the round

                    [2nd verse]
                    She told me her name was Billie Jean, as she caused a scene
                    Then every head turned with eyes that dreamed of being the one
                    Who will dance on the floor in the round

                    [Bridge]
                    People always told me be careful of what you do
                    And don't go around breaking young girls' hearts
                    And mother always told me be careful of who you love
                    And be careful of what you do 'cause the lie becomes the truth

                    [Chorus]
                    Billie Jean is not my lover
                    She's just a girl who claims that I am the one
                    But the kid is not my son
                    She says I am the one, but the kid is not my son

                    [3rd verse]
                    For forty days and forty nights
                    The law was on her side
                    But who can stand when she's in demand
                    Her schemes and plans
                    'cause we danced on the floor in the round
                    So take my strong advice, just remember to always think twice
                    (do think twice.)

                    [4th verse]
                    She told my baby we'd danced 'til three
                    Then she looked at me
                    She showed a photo of a baby crying
                    His eyes looked like mine
                    Go on dance on the floor in the round, baby

                    [Bridge]
                    People always told me be careful of what you do
                    And don't go around breaking young girls' hearts
                    She came and stood right by me
                    Then the smell of sweet perfume
                    This happened much too soon
                    She called me to her room

                    [Chorus]
                    Billie Jean is not my lover
                    She's just a girl who claims that I am the one

                    It's amazing how you can speak right to my heart

                    Try as I may I could never explain
                    What I hear when you don't say a thing

                    The smile on your face lets me know that you need me
                    There's a truth in your eyes sayin' you'll never leave me
                    The touch of your hand says you'll catch me if ever I fall
                    You say it best when you say nothing at all

                    All day long I can hear people talking out loud
                    But when you hold me near, you drown out the crowd
