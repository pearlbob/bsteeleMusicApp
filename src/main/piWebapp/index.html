<h1>Yeah! you've found bob's Raspberry Pi 5</h1>
<p>Welcome. It's here to serve the bsteele Music App used by CommunityJams.org in a live environment.
</p>
<h2>Notes:</h2>
<ul>
    <li>It might be useful on a cell phone but you're much better off with a tablet or larger.</li>
    <li>Be sure to set the screen timeout as long as possible to avoid re-starting the tablet often.</li>
    <li>For best performance, close all other apps on your tablet/phone.
        This is particularly true on an ipad. Use Chrome (preferred) or Safari, and close the other
        (double-click home button, flick up on all apps but Chrome.
    </li>
    <li>Bookmark this page or the bsteele Music App page itself.</li>
    <li>Try the full screen button under the Options tab.</li>
    <li>I would suggest you plug it into a power supply if you have one... you might be here a while!</li>
</ul>

<h2>Try:
    <a id="trans">bsteeleMusicApp</a>
    <script>
        document.getElementById('trans').href = window.location.origin + ':8080/bsteeleMusicApp';
    </script>
</h2>
<p>
    That is:
    <script>
        document.write(`${window.location.origin}:8080/bsteeleMusicApp`);
    </script>
</p>
